# DR-003: Animation Specifications

Status: ENHANCED

## Overview
As an Interaction Designer, I need smooth, meaningful animations that enhance user experience without causing distraction or performance issues in a scholarly publishing platform. This requirement defines animation principles, timing, and implementation guidelines for page transitions and micro-interactions.

## Business Value
Well-crafted animations guide user attention, provide visual feedback, and create a polished, professional feel that builds trust and engagement. Effective animations improve perceived performance and make complex interactions more intuitive.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Motion Designers, Frontend Developers, and UX Designers
- Secondary: Product Managers and QA Testers
- Tertiary: End users and performance analysts

## Value Propositions
- **User Guidance**: Animations that direct attention and clarify interactions
- **Performance Perception**: Smooth transitions that make the app feel faster
- **Professional Polish**: High-quality animations that enhance brand perception
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion options and performance considerations
- **Consistency**: Standardized animation library across all components

## Revenue Model
- Indirect: Improved user satisfaction leads to higher retention
- Premium Experience: Smooth animations as part of premium features
- Brand Differentiation: Superior user experience attracts more users

## Success Metrics
- **Animation Performance**: <16ms frame times on target devices
- **User Preference**: >70% users keep animations enabled
- **Task Completion**: No impact on task completion times
- **Accessibility Compliance**: 100% support for reduced motion preferences
- **Cross-Device Consistency**: <5% variation in animation timing across devices

## Visual/Interactive Specifications
- **Animation Library**: Centralized animation system with presets
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time frame rate monitoring
- **Accessibility Controls**: Reduced motion toggle and testing
- **Device Optimization**: Adaptive animation based on device capabilities
- **Preview Tools**: Animation timeline and easing curve editors

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance Budget**: 60fps target with GPU acceleration
- **Framework Integration**: CSS animations with JavaScript fallbacks
- **Accessibility**: Respect user motion preferences
- **Cross-Browser**: Consistent behavior across all supported browsers
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly animation durations

## Technical Specifications

### Page Turn Transition

**Animation Details**:
```
Duration: 600ms
Easing: cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1) // easeInOutCubic

Keyframes:
0%   → Current page: translateX(0), opacity(1)
        Next page: translateX(100%), opacity(0)
50%  → Current page: translateX(-50%), opacity(0.5)
        Next page: translateX(50%), opacity(0.5)
100% → Current page: translateX(-100%), opacity(0)
        Next page: translateX(0), opacity(1)

Overlay: Black gradient sweep (30% opacity)
```

**Implementation**:
- CSS Transform3D for hardware acceleration
- Z-index management for layering
- Event handling for interruption

### Author's Gloss Expansion

**Animation Sequence**:
```
Duration: 300ms
Easing: ease-out

Phase 1 (0-150ms):
   - Text line: scaleY(1 → 2)
   - Definition: opacity(0 → 1), translateY(10px → 0)

Phase 2 (150-300ms):
   - Background: opacity(0 → 0.95)
   - Border-left: width(0 → 3px)
```

**Interaction States**:
- Hover: Preview expansion
- Click: Full expansion with content load
- Dismiss: Reverse animation

### Animation Principles

**Timing Guidelines**:
- Micro-interactions: 150-300ms
- Page transitions: 300-600ms
- Loading states: 200-400ms
- Error states: 300ms with bounce

**Easing Curves**:
- Standard: ease-out for entrances
- Dramatic: ease-in-out for page changes
- Playful: bounce for success states
- Subtle: linear for progress bars

### Performance Optimizations

**Hardware Acceleration**:
- Transform and opacity properties prioritized
- Will-change declarations for animated elements
- Layer promotion for complex animations

**Reduced Motion Support**:
- Media query detection
- Animation duration set to 0ms
- Opacity changes maintained for visibility

## Implementation Notes
- **Animation Library**: GSAP or Framer Motion integration
- **State Management**: Animation state coordination with UI state
- **Testing**: Performance testing on target devices
- **Documentation**: Animation guidelines and usage examples
- **Version Control**: Animation changes tracked with component updates

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Performance Issues**: Mitigation - Performance budgets and monitoring
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Mitigation - User preference detection and alternatives
- **Browser Inconsistencies**: Mitigation - Fallback animations and testing
- **Battery Impact**: Mitigation - Reduced animations on low-power mode
- **Cognitive Load**: Mitigation - Subtle animations that don't distract
