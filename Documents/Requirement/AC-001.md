# AC-001: Constellation Tagging System

Status: ENHANCED

## Overview
As a Product Owner, I need a mandatory 3-tier tagging system that ensures all posts are properly categorized and discoverable within the platform's knowledge graph. This acceptance criteria defines the behavior for authors publishing content and readers navigating through tagged content, ensuring a structured and intuitive exploration experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Scenario 1: Author attempts to publish without tags**
```
GIVEN an author has written a complete post
WHEN they click "Publish"
  AND one or more Constellation tags are unselected
THEN display modal: "Complete Your Constellation"
  AND highlight missing tag fields in crimson
  AND disable "Publish" button until all 3 tags selected
```

**Scenario 2: Reader navigates via tag**
```
GIVEN a reader is viewing "The Nature of Justice"
WHEN they click the "Political Theory" (Domain) thread in Weave Header
THEN Context Drawer slides in from right within 300ms
  AND displays posts sorted by Foundational → Chronological → Controversial
  AND shows minimum 5 related posts (if available)
  AND drawer header displays total post count for that tag
```

**Scenario 3: Tag hierarchy navigation**
```
GIVEN "Political Theory" is a child of "Philosophy" (Domain)
WHEN reader clicks "Political Theory"
THEN Context Drawer shows breadcrumb: Philosophy → Political Theory
  AND "View all Philosophy posts" link appears in drawer footer
```

## Business Value
The Constellation Tagging System creates a structured knowledge ecosystem that enhances content discoverability, improves user engagement, and establishes the platform as a premium scholarly resource. By mandating comprehensive tagging, it ensures content quality, enables sophisticated search and recommendation algorithms, and fosters deeper intellectual connections between related works.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Authors seeking to maximize content visibility and scholarly impact
- Secondary: Readers exploring interconnected topics and building knowledge networks
- Tertiary: Academic institutions and researchers requiring organized content repositories

## Value Propositions
- **Structured Discovery**: Hierarchical tagging enables intuitive navigation through complex intellectual landscapes
- **Content Quality Assurance**: Mandatory tagging ensures posts are thoughtfully categorized and contextually rich
- **Enhanced Engagement**: Tag-based exploration encourages serendipitous discovery and prolonged reading sessions
- **Scholarly Credibility**: Systematic organization positions the platform as a trusted academic resource

## Success Metrics
- **Tagging Compliance**: 100% of published posts have complete 3-tier tags
- **Navigation Usage**: Average 2.5 tag clicks per reading session
- **Content Discovery**: 30% increase in related content views through tag navigation
- **Author Satisfaction**: >85% author approval rating for tagging workflow
- **Reader Retention**: 25% longer session duration for tag-exploring users

## Visual/Interactive Specifications
- **Publishing Interface**:
  - Tag selection modal with 3-tier hierarchy (Domain → Topic → Subtopic)
  - Crimson highlighting for incomplete fields with smooth fade-in animation
  - Disabled publish button with tooltip explaining requirements
- **Weave Header**:
  - Interactive tag threads with hover effects showing post counts
  - Smooth slide-in animation for Context Drawer (300ms ease-out)
- **Context Drawer**:
  - Right-side panel with breadcrumb navigation
  - Post sorting controls (Foundational, Chronological, Controversial)
  - Minimum 5 related posts display with lazy loading for more
  - Footer link for broader category exploration

## Technical Considerations
- **Database Design**: Hierarchical tag structure with foreign key relationships and indexing for fast queries
- **Performance**: Efficient tag-based search with caching for popular tag combinations
- **Scalability**: Support for dynamic tag hierarchies with migration support for schema changes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation for tag selection and screen reader support for drawer content
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly tag selection and drawer adaptation for small screens

## Implementation Notes
- **MVP Scope**: Implement basic 3-tier tagging with validation; enhance drawer features in subsequent iterations
- **A/B Testing**: Test tag hierarchy depth and drawer animation speeds for optimal UX
- **Analytics**: Track tag usage patterns to refine taxonomy and improve recommendations
- **Migration**: Existing untagged content requires bulk tagging or grandfathering strategy

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Author Resistance**: Mitigation - Provide intuitive UI with progressive disclosure and helpful tooltips
- **Tag Inconsistency**: Mitigation - Implement tag suggestion AI and community curation processes
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigation - Optimize database queries and implement caching layers
- **Taxonomy Evolution**: Mitigation - Design flexible schema allowing tag hierarchy modifications without data loss
