# Maa Biraja Shakti Peetha: An Archetypal Monograph on the History, Theology, and Living Traditions of the Viraja Kshetra

## 1\. Introduction: The Primordial Seat of Shakti in Utkala

In the sacred geography of the Indian subcontinent, where the physical landscape is inscribed with the divine interplay of cosmic forces, the **Biraja Kshetra** in Jajpur, Odisha, occupies a position of supreme eminence. Known historically as "Viraja Kshetra" and recognized as the "Second Srikshetra" of Odisha after Puri, this pilgrimage site is not merely a temple complex but a spiritual nerve center that has pulsed with the rhythms of Shaktism, Shaivism, and Tantra for nearly two millennia.<sup>1</sup> It stands as one of the 51 _Shakti Peethas_-and according to the _Ashtadasha Shakti Peetha Stuti_ of Adi Shankara, one of the elite 18 _Maha Shakti Peethas_-marking the locus where the navel (_nabhi_) of the Goddess Sati fell, thereby sanctifying the earth as a conduit for ancestral liberation and cosmic power.<sup>1</sup>

The Maa Biraja Temple is unique in the subcontinent for its synthesis of diverse theological streams. While it is a preeminent seat of the Mother Goddess, worshiped as _Mahishasuramardini_ (the slayer of the buffalo demon), the site is also renowned as "Nabhi Gaya," a _Pitru Tirtha_ (ancestral pilgrimage site) rivaling the sanctity of Gaya in Bihar.<sup>3</sup> Here, the boundaries between the living and the dead, the divine and the mortal, are believed to dissolve within the triangular geography of the _Kshetra_, guarded by Shiva lingams at its vertices and anchored by the Goddess at its center.<sup>6</sup>

This report offers an exhaustive analysis of the Maa Biraja Shakti Peetha. It dissects the layers of history that transformed a tribal worship site into a state capital under the Bhaumakara and Somavamsi dynasties; it unravels the complex tapestry of the _Sthala Purana_ (local mythology) that connects the site to the Great Deluge and the sacrifice of demons; and it provides a granular guide for the modern pilgrim navigating the rituals, logistics, and spiritual offerings of this ancient _Tirtha_. Through a detailed examination of archaeology, scripture, and living tradition, we explore why Jajpur remains a cornerstone of Indian spiritual heritage.<sup>1</sup>

## 2\. The Sthala Purana: Mythological Foundations and Theological Significance

The sanctity of the Biraja Temple is rooted in the _Sthala Purana_, the corpus of local legends that imbue the physical landscape with metaphysical meaning. These narratives are not mere folklore; they are theological assertions that define the relationship between the deity, the land, and the devotee.

### 2.1 The Shakti Peetha: The Legend of Sati's Navel

The foundational myth of the Biraja Temple is the tragic narrative of Sati, the first consort of Lord Shiva. As recounted in the _Shiva Purana_, _Kalika Purana_, and the _Devi Bhagavata_, Sati immolated herself in the sacrificial fire of her father, Daksha Prajapati, unable to bear the insults heaped upon her husband. In his grief-stricken rage, Shiva traversed the universe carrying her charred corpse, his _Tandava_ (dance of destruction) threatening the cosmos. To restore order, Lord Vishnu employed his _Sudarshana Chakra_ to dissect the body of Sati, scattering her remains across the Indian subcontinent.<sup>4</sup>

Jajpur is consecrated as the site where the **Navel (_Nabhi_)** of the Goddess fell. In Tantric physiology, the navel is the _Manipura Chakra_, the center of fire, vitality, and maintenance. It is the point of origin for the physical body (the umbilical connection) and the stabilizing force of the universe.<sup>3</sup> Consequently, the Goddess here is not merely a destroyer of demons but the _Adya Shakti_-the primordial source of life and sustenance. This designation transforms the temple into a "Nabhi Gaya," linking the feminine power of generation with the rites of the ancestors.<sup>5</sup>

This identification is supported by the _Tantra Chudamani_, which explicitly states that the navel fell in Utkala (Odisha), naming the presiding deity as Viraja and the Bhairava as Jagannath. The ancient text _Brahmayamala Tantra_ also dedicates the "Aadya Stotra" to this manifestation, reinforcing the site's primacy in the Shakta tradition.<sup>9</sup>

### 2.2 The Gayasura Myth: The Sacrifice of the Demon Devotee

Complementing the Shakti legend is the Vaishnavite myth of the demon Gayasura, which establishes Jajpur's significance for ancestral rituals. According to the _Gaya Mahatmya_ section of the _Vayu Purana_, Gayasura was a devout _asura_ whose austere penance on the Kolahala Mountain granted him such purity that merely touching him absolved sinners of all karmic debts, sending them directly to _Vaikuntha_ (the abode of Vishnu). This disrupted the cosmic balance, as the _Yamaloka_ (realm of the dead) became desolate, leaving Yama, the God of Death, without his function.<sup>8</sup>

To restore the equilibrium of karma, the gods, led by Brahma and Vishnu, approached Gayasura and requested his body to perform a supreme sacrifice. The pious demon agreed, laying his colossal form across the land. His head rested in Gaya (Bihar), his feet in Pithapuram (Andhra Pradesh), and his **Navel** rested in Jajpur (Odisha).<sup>8</sup> This tripartite distribution of his body created the three great _Gaya Kshetras_:

- **Siro Gaya:** Gaya, Bihar (Head)
- **Nabhi Gaya:** Jajpur, Odisha (Navel)
- **Pada Gaya:** Pithapuram, Andhra Pradesh (Feet)

After the sacrifice, Vishnu granted Gayasura a boon: these three sites would become the holiest places for _Pinda Daan_ (offering to ancestors). Anyone who performs funeral rites at the Nabhi Gaya in Jajpur is believed to liberate twenty-one generations of ancestors.<sup>5</sup> This myth effectively synthesizes the worship of the Goddess (Shakta) with the worship of Vishnu (Vaishnava) within the temple complex, creating a syncretic space where the navel of the Goddess and the navel of the demon converge to offer salvation.

### 2.3 The Brahma Yajna and the Emergence of Biraja

A third layer of mythology concerns the specific manifestation of the Goddess as "Biraja" (She who is without dust/rajas, or the Immaculate One). The _Biraja Kshetra Mahatmya_ and _Brahmanda Purana_ narrate that Lord Brahma performed a great _Yajna_ (sacrifice) on the banks of the Vaitarani River. This ritual was the _Dasaswamedha Yajna_ (sacrifice of ten horses), a rite of supreme sovereignty and purification.<sup>6</sup>

From the sacrificial fire (_Garhapatya Agni_) of this Yajna, the Goddess emerged in her immaculate form. Brahma, awestruck by her radiance, entreated her to reside in the _Kshetra_ to sanctify the land. She agreed, on the condition that she would be the presiding deity of the region and that the region would be named after her. Thus, the river Vaitarani became a celestial river, capable of washing away sins, and the land became _Viraja Kshetra_.<sup>6</sup> This myth highlights the Vedic roots of the temple, linking the Tantric goddess to orthodox Vedic rites performed by the Creator himself.

The _Skanda Purana_, _Vayu Purana_, and _Mahabharata_ (Vanaparva, Chapter 85) all contain references to the "Viraja Tirtha," attesting to the antiquity of this belief system. The Mahabharata specifically mentions it as a place where Dharma (the God of Righteousness) performed sacrifices, further solidifying its status as a pivotal Aryan religious site that eventually assimilated local tribal goddess traditions.<sup>11</sup>

## 3\. Historical Background: Dynastic Patronage and Socio-Political Evolution

The history of the Biraja Temple is the history of Odisha's religious evolution. The site provides archaeological evidence of the transition from Buddhism and tribal worship to the codified Hindu temple structures of the Kalinga dynasties.

### 3.1 The Early Period: Guptas and Pre-Historic Significance

While the current structure dates to a later period, the antiquity of the site is attested to by pre-historic and early historic references. Historians like K.C. Panigrahi suggest that the region gained prominence as a pilgrimage site as early as the Gupta period (4th-5th century CE).<sup>7</sup> A temple for Biraja Devi is believed to have existed during the Gupta rule, likely a modest structure with a flat-roofed _Jagamohana_ and a _Rekha Vimana_, typical of the nascent stages of Kalinga architecture.<sup>7</sup>

The region was known as _Guheshwarpataka_ or _Vinitapura_ in ancient times and served as a crucial political center. The presence of the Goddess served as a legitimizing force for early rulers, who sought divine sanction for their authority over the fertile delta of the Vaitarani River.<sup>2</sup>

### 3.2 The Bhaumakara Dynasty: The Tantric Renaissance (8th-10th Century CE)

The **Bhaumakara Dynasty** marked a golden age for the _Kshetra_. This dynasty is notable for its religious tolerance and the prominence of female rulers (Queens), which naturally fostered the growth of Shaktism and Tantra. During this era, Jajpur served as the capital, and the rulers actively patronized the synthesis of tribal goddess worship with Brahmanical Hinduism.<sup>7</sup>

Under the Bhaumakaras, Biraja Kshetra was developed into a full-fledged _Shakti Peetha_. The dynasty was instrumental in establishing the subsidiary shrines that define the Tantric mandala of the site. They installed the:

- **Sapta Matrikas** (Seven Mothers)
- **Asta Chandis** (Eight Chandis)
- **Asta Bhairavas** (Eight Bhairavas)
- **Sixty-Four Yoginis** (Chausathi Yogini)

The Bhaumakara period sculptures found in the compound wall, dating to the 8th-10th centuries, attest to this vibrant period of artistic activity. The intense focus on female divinity during this period aligned with the dynasty's political structure, where queens like Tribhuvana Mahadevi ruled with full imperial titles.<sup>13</sup>

### 3.3 The Somavamsi Era: The Construction of the Great Temple (10th-11th Century CE)

The most transformative period for the Biraja Temple occurred under the **Somavamsi Dynasty**. The Somavamsis, who were staunch Shaivites, fully integrated the Shakta worship of Biraja into the Brahmanical fold, creating a "Shakta-Shaiva" synthesis.

King **Yayati Kesari II (Candihara Yayati II)** is credited with the construction of the present temple structure. While some sources date the completion to the 13th century, the core architectural style and the reign of Yayati II suggest a significant construction phase in the 11th century.<sup>9</sup> This King renamed the capital _Abhinava Yaynagara_ (New City of Sacrifice).

The Somavamsis are responsible for instituting the **Ratha Yatra** (Chariot Festival) for the Goddess. This was a revolutionary ritual innovation. While chariot festivals were known for male deities (like the later Jagannath tradition), a Ratha Yatra for a Goddess was exceptionally rare. By giving the Goddess a chariot, the Somavamsis symbolically asserted her status as the supreme sovereign of the land, equal to or surpassing the male gods.<sup>7</sup>

### 3.4 The Suryavamshi Gajapatis and Later History

The **Suryavamshi Gajapati** rulers (15th-16th century) continued the patronage. King Prataparudra Deva is associated with the construction of the nearby Varahanatha Temple, further cementing the Vaishnavite-Shakta synthesis.<sup>15</sup>

However, the temple faced the brutality of iconoclasm. In the mid-16th century, the Afghan general **Kalapahar**, serving the Bengal Sultanate, invaded Odisha. Known as the "Destroyer of Temples," Kalapahar inflicted severe damage on the temples of Jajpur, including the Biraja Temple. He attempted to desecrate the sanctity of the _Kshetra_, forcing the local priests to hide the main idol to protect it from destruction.<sup>16</sup>

The temple lay in a state of partial disrepair until the **19th century**, when it was reconstructed and repaired by a local Zamindar, **Sudarshan Mohapatra**. He restored the sanctity of the shrine, repaired the damaged structures, and ensured the continuity of the rituals, preserving the legacy for the modern era.<sup>16</sup>

## 4\. Architectural Grandeur and Epigraphy

The Biraja Temple is a quintessential example of **Kalinga Architecture**, characterized by its curvilinear spire (_Rekha Deula_) and pyramidal assembly hall (_Pidha Deula_). However, its iconographic program is distinct, reflecting its specific theological orientation.

### 4.1 Temple Layout and The Vimana

The temple complex is enclosed by a high compound wall, fortification-like in its appearance, indicative of the "Gada Kshetra" (Fortress Zone) designation. This wall contains reused stone blocks from earlier eras, some bearing inscriptions and sculptural fragments.<sup>1</sup>

- **The Vimana (Main Sanctum):** The main tower housing the deity is a _Rekha Deula_. It stands tall with the classic curvilinear shape of Odia temples, crowned by an _Amalaka_ and a _Kalasha_.
- **The Jagamohana (Audience Hall):** Connected to the sanctum is the _Jagamohana_, a _Pidha Deula_ with a stepped pyramidal roof. This is where devotees gather for _darshan_.
- **The Lion Gate (Simhadwara):** The main entrance is from the east, flanked by imposing sculptures of lions and elephants. A notable motif here is the **Lion subduing the Elephant**. This is widely interpreted as a political symbol of the Keshari (Lion) dynasty asserting dominance over the rival Gajapati (Elephant) dynasty or other elephant-associated powers, reinforcing the royal nature of the temple.<sup>13</sup>

### 4.2 The Unique Iconography of Maa Biraja

The presiding deity, Goddess Biraja, presents an iconographic form that is extremely rare in Indian art history. Unlike the popular eight-armed (_Ashtabhuja_) or ten-armed (_Dashabhuja_) depictions of Durga seen in Bengal and later Odia art, Maa Biraja is **Dwibhuja** (two-armed).<sup>1</sup>

- **The Posture:** She stands in a dynamic, warrior-like pose (_Pratyalidha_). Her right leg is planted firmly on the chest of the demon Mahishasura, while her left leg rests on her mount, the Lion.
- **The Weapons:**
  - **Right Hand:** She holds a **Spear (Shula)**, piercing the chest of the demon.
  - **Left Hand:** She pulls the **Tail** of the buffalo demon.
  - _Significance:_ This specific posture-holding the tail while spearing the chest-depicts the exact moment of subduing the demon's transformative power. As Mahishasura attempts to shift forms to escape, the Goddess pins him down. It represents the absolute control of the divine will over the chaotic ego.<sup>1</sup>
- **The Demon:** Mahishasura is depicted here in his theriomorphic form as a water buffalo (_Mahisha_), not as a human emerging from a buffalo. This indicates the antiquity of the iconographic tradition, likely predating the crystallized anthropomorphic forms of the later medieval period.<sup>1</sup>

### 4.3 The Crown: A Syncretic Masterpiece

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the idol is her **Crown (Karanda Mukuta)**, which serves as a visual manifesto of religious synthesis. It is a theological statement carved in stone.<sup>1</sup> The crown features diverse symbols:

- **Ganesha:** The elephant-headed god is carved into the crown. He represents wisdom, the removal of obstacles, and the synthesis of Aryan and non-Aryan cultures.
- **Shiva Linga:** Symbolizing Shaivism, procreation, and her status as the consort of Shiva.
- **Crescent Moon (Indu):** A symbol of Shiva (Chandrashekhara) and the cooling, nurturing aspect of the Mother (Amrita).
- **Serpent (Phani/Vasuki):** Representing the _Kundalini_ energy and the cosmic balance of good and evil.
- **Yoni:** The female generative organ, symbolizing the creative power of the _Shakti_.

This amalgamation asserts that Maa Biraja is not just a sect-specific deity but the _Adi Parashakti_ (Supreme Power), encompassing all male and female divinities. She _wears_ the gods; she is not merely one of them.<sup>7</sup>

### 4.4 Subsidiary Shrines and the "Crore" Lingams

The temple complex is a microcosm of the Hindu pantheon, designed to accommodate all sects within the Shakta fold.

- **Bagalamukhi Temple:** Located behind the main sanctum, this shrine is dedicated to one of the _Dasa Mahavidyas_. The Goddess here holds a cudgel (club), using it to smash the delusions and myths of her devotees. It features a porch with lion sculptures.<sup>16</sup>
- **Shiva Shrines:** Jajpur is mythologically rumored to possess "One Crore" (Koti) Shiva lingams. The temple complex houses several key lingams that guard the _Kshetra_. The most prominent are:
  - _Isanesvara_
  - _Jupesvara_
  - _Mrityunjayesvara_
  - _Bhusandesvara_
  - _Vaidyanatha_
  - _Baneswar_
  - _Lokanatheswar_
- **The Wishing Tree:** A large **Bakul** tree within the premises is draped in red cloth and bangles. Devotees tie these cloths to petition the Goddess for fertility, marriage, or health.<sup>1</sup>

## 5\. Nabhi Gaya: The Portal to Ancestral Liberation

Within the Biraja Temple complex lies the **Nabhi Gaya**, a site of immense soteriological importance. It is physically manifested as a fathomless well (_Nabhi Kupa_) located near the main temple.<sup>8</sup>

### 5.1 The Ritual of Pinda Daan

While _Pinda Daan_ (offering of rice balls to ancestors) is typically associated with Lord Vishnu (as in Gaya, Bihar), Jajpur presents a unique Shakta variation. Here, the offerings are made into the Nabhi well, directly to the Goddess Biraja, who is regarded as the bestower of liberation (_Moksha_) for the departed souls. This subverts the usual gender dynamics of ancestral rites, placing the Mother Goddess as the ultimate agent of liberation.<sup>20</sup>

Devotees flock to this well to perform rituals for:

- **Pitru Dosh Nivaran:** Remedying astrological afflictions caused by ancestral unrest.
- **Moksha for Ancestors:** It is believed that offering Pinda here liberates **twenty-one generations** of ancestors. This potency is derived from the navel of Gayasura (the demon devotee) and Sati (the divine mother).<sup>5</sup>

### 5.2 Ritual Procedure

The procedure at Nabhi Gaya is rigorous and conducted by the temple priests:

- **Sankalpa:** The devotee takes a vow to perform the rite.
- **Pinda Preparation:** Rice balls mixed with sesame and other sacred ingredients are prepared.
- **Offering:** The Pindas are offered into the _Nabhi Kupa_ (the well).
- Tarpan: Water is offered to satisfy the thirst of the ancestors.  
    This ritual is considered as effective as the rituals performed at the Vishnupad Temple in Bihar, making Jajpur a critical destination for those unable to travel to Gaya.8

## 6\. Rituals, Festivals, and the Calendar

The Biraja Temple is not a static monument but a living institution with a calendar vibrant with festivals that reflect its synthesis of Vedic and Tantric traditions. The daily rituals are a blend of _Tantra_ and _Agama_ traditions, performed by the Brahmins of Jajpur.<sup>1</sup>

### 6.1 The Simhadhwaja Ratha Yatra

The most distinctive festival of Jajpur is the **Ratha Yatra** of Goddess Biraja. While chariot festivals are common for male deities (like Jagannath), a Ratha Yatra for a Goddess is exceptionally rare.<sup>9</sup>

#### The Chariot: Simhadhwaja

The chariot is a complex theological vehicle. It is named **Simhadhwaja** (Lion-Flagged) and is constructed anew or refurbished for the festival. Its specifications are precise and laden with symbolism.<sup>21</sup>

### **Table 1: Specifications of the Simhadhwaja Chariot**

| **Component** | **Detail / Name** | **Significance** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | Simhadhwaja / Vijaya Ratha | The Chariot of Victory with the Lion Flag. |

| --- | --- | --- |

The festival spans nine days during _Sharadiya Durga Puja_. The Goddess traverses the perimeter of the temple complex, symbolizing her inspection of her kingdom and the revitalization of the _Kshetra_.

### 6.2 Sharadiya Durga Puja and Animal Sacrifice

The Durga Puja at Biraja Temple is a 16-day event (_Shodasha Dinatatmika Puja_), beginning on _Krishna Paksha Ashtami_ and culminating on _Vijayadashami_.<sup>9</sup>

- **Bali Daanam (Sacrifice):** A controversial yet persistent tradition is the **Bali Daanam** (animal sacrifice). On the junction of _Shukla Ashtami_ and _Navami_ (Sandhi Puja), a buffalo is sacrificed to the Goddess. While modern laws have curtailed public sacrifices in many places, this ritual continues in Biraja Kshetra as a vital part of the Tantric liturgy, symbolizing the reenactment of the slaying of Mahishasura. It is considered essential for maintaining the energy of the _Shakti Peetha_.<sup>9</sup>
- **Aparajita Puja:** On Dussehra, the Goddess is worshipped as _Aparajita_ (The Unconquered), reinforcing her martial nature.<sup>13</sup>

### 6.3 Triveni Amavasya: The Appearance Day

Celebrated in the month of _Magha_ (January-February), **Triveni Amavasya** marks the **Birthday of Goddess Biraja** (her emergence from the Yajna fire).

- **Rituals:** The deity receives a _Maha Snana_ (Great Bath) and is adorned in the _Savitri Besha_ (form of the Solar Goddess). A special Yajna is performed, and _Chakuli Pitha_ (a traditional Odia rice cake) is offered as _Bhog_.<sup>4</sup>
- **Significance:** It is believed that a _darshan_ (viewing) of the Goddess on this day washes away the sins of multiple lifetimes. The "Triveni" refers to the confluence of three rivers (Vaitarani and two others, possibly metaphysical).<sup>23</sup>

### 6.4 Other Key Festivals

- **Varuni Snana:** In the month of _Chaitra_ (March-April), devotees and the representative image of the Goddess take a holy dip in the Vaitarani River at the Dasaswamedha Ghat. This commemorates the descent of the river and its purifying power.
- **Prathamastami:** This festival celebrates the firstborn child (_Podhuan_) in the family. It is deeply rooted in Odia culture. At the temple, special prayers are offered for the longevity of the firstborn, and _Enduri Pitha_ (steamed turmeric-leaf cakes) are offered to the Goddess.<sup>24</sup>
- **Raja Parva:** A three-day festival celebrating womanhood and the earth's menstruation. The temple becomes a hub of activity as women celebrate fertility and the agricultural cycle.<sup>25</sup>

## 7\. Location Details: Geography and Sacred Surroundings

### 7.1 Geography of the Kshetra

Jajpur is situated on the banks of the **Vaitarani River**, a river charged with mythological significance comparable to the Ganges. The town is triangular in shape, bounded by the river and dotted with hills.

- **Coordinates:** 20°50′N 86°20′E.<sup>9</sup>
- **Triangle of Power:** The _Biraja Kshetra_ is conceptualized as a triangle. The Goddess sits at the center, while Shiva lingams protect the corners, creating a spiritual force field that "washes away the Rajo Guna" (passion/impurity) of the pilgrim.<sup>1</sup>

### 7.2 Nearby Sacred Sites

A visit to Biraja Temple is often combined with other significant shrines in Jajpur, creating a circuit of worship:

- **Varahanatha Temple:** Located on an island in the Vaitarani River, about 1 km from the bus station. It is dedicated to the Boar incarnation of Vishnu (Varaha) and marks the site of the Brahma Yajna (Dasaswamedha Ghat). The temple faces the threat of floods but remains a crucial Vaishnava counterpart to the Shakta Biraja temple.<sup>15</sup>
- **Sapta Matrika Shrine:** Located at the Dasaswamedha Ghat, this shrine houses colossal images of the Seven Mothers: _Chamunda, Varahi, Indrani, Vaishnavi, Brahmi, Kaumari, and Maheshwari_. These deities are considered the attendants of Goddess Biraja and protectors of the city.<sup>28</sup>
- **Jagannath Temple:** A historic temple within Jajpur (distinct from Puri), reflecting the synthesis of Jagannath culture with the local Shakta tradition. Though the original was destroyed by Kalapahar, the restored temple continues the legacy.<sup>4</sup>

## 8\. Visitor Details: A Comprehensive Guide

Recent incidents involving foreign tourists entering the premises have led to friction, reinforcing the strict adherence to these traditions. Visitors should respect these boundaries and inquire with temple authorities before entering inner zones.<sup>36</sup>
- **Photography:** Usually prohibited inside the main sanctum but often allowed in the outer complex.

## 9\. Conclusion

The Maa Biraja Shakti Peetha is a testament to the enduring power of the divine feminine in Indian civilization. It is a site where the blood of the buffalo demon, the ashes of Sati, and the pious sacrifice of Gayasura have commingled to create a landscape of profound spiritual potency.

From the two-armed warrior goddess who predates the standard iconography of Durga, to the "Simhadhwaja" chariot that rolls through the streets proclaiming her sovereignty, Jajpur challenges and expands our understanding of Shakta traditions. It serves as a bridge-between the Vedic and the Tantric, the Shaiva and the Shakta, the living and the ancestral. For the devotee, it is a place of liberation (_Nabhi Gaya_); for the historian, it is a chronicle of Odisha's dynastic glory; and for the seeker, it remains, as it has for centuries, the immaculate "Viraja Kshetra"-the realm without dust, where the Goddess reigns supreme.
