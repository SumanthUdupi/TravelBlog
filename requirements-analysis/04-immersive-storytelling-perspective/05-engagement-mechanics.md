# Engagement Mechanics & Retention

## Summary
Tactical methods to increase retention and return visits via story-driven hooks and social features.

## Mechanics
- **Completion badges / micro-achievements** for visiting routes or reading narratives
- **Email drip** for serialized narratives or route follow-ups
- **User-generated contributions** with moderation (local stories, photos)
- **Sustained storytelling** (chaptered narratives released over time)

## Measurement
- Track completion rates for micro-quests
- Monitor repeat visits and re-engagement after drip emails
- A/B test badge vs. non-badge onboarding flows

## Action Items
1. Implement a lightweight achievement system (track read/visited)
2. Set up a serialized narrative email campaign for registered users
3. Design moderation workflow for user-submitted stories
