# The Black Pagoda: An Exhaustive Analytical Report on the Konark Sun Temple

## Executive Summary and Introduction

The Konark Sun Temple, situated on the eastern shores of the Indian subcontinent in Odisha, represents the zenith of Kalingan temple architecture and stands as one of the most significant monuments of the medieval world. Constructed in the mid-13th century under the patronage of King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, this colossal structure was conceived not merely as a place of worship but as a monumental stone chariot for the Sun God, Surya. Its conceptual grandeur, engineering complexity, and artistic intricacy have earned it the designation of a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the enduring moniker of the "Black Pagoda" among European mariners who once navigated by its towering silhouette.<sup>1</sup>

This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of the temple's history, the _Sthala Purana_ (sacred local legends) that sanctify its geography, the architectural and metallurgical innovations that defined its construction, the enduring myths of its decline, and the practical realities for visitors in the contemporary era of 2025. By synthesizing archaeological data, historical chronicles, and oral traditions, this document aims to reconstruct the full majesty of Konark, offering a nuanced understanding of its place in human history.

The analysis reveals that Konark was the product of a unique confluence of political ambition, religious fervor, and scientific prowess. It was built during a period when the Eastern Ganga kingdom was asserting its military dominance against the Delhi Sultanate, making the temple a victory monument as much as a spiritual one.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, the presence of foreign design elements-specifically in the iconography of the solar priests-suggests a cosmopolitan exchange of ideas between Odisha and the Persian world, mediated by the legend of the Maga Brahmins.<sup>5</sup> Today, despite the collapse of its main sanctum (_Vimana_), the surviving assembly hall (_Jagamohana_) and the ruinous dance hall (_Nata Mandira_) continue to testify to an engineering sophistication that utilized massive iron beams and floating foundations centuries before the Industrial Revolution.<sup>7</sup>

## Part I: Historical Background and Political Context

### 1.1 The Geopolitical Landscape of 13th Century Odisha

To fully grasp the significance of the Konark Sun Temple, one must situate it within the turbulent geopolitical climate of 13th-century Eastern India. The Eastern Ganga Dynasty, which had ruled the region of Kalinga (modern-day Odisha) since the 5th century, reached its political and military apogee under King Narasimhadeva I (reigned 1238-1264 CE).<sup>1</sup>

Unlike his predecessors, who were primarily concerned with consolidation and defense, Narasimhadeva I adopted an aggressive military posture. The early 13th century saw the rapid expansion of the Delhi Sultanate and the consolidation of Islamic rule in Bengal under governors like Tughral Tughan Khan. The traditional narrative of Indian history often highlights the defensive retreats of Hindu kingdoms during this period; however, the historical records of Odisha, specifically the _Madala Panji_ (chronicle of the Jagannath Temple) and copper plate inscriptions, paint a different picture for Kalinga.<sup>1</sup>

Narasimhadeva I launched a preemptive military campaign into Bengal (Vanga), engaging the forces of the Sultanate on their own territory. His decisive victory against Tughral Tughan Khan at Katasin (in present-day West Bengal) was a watershed moment. It secured the northern frontiers of Odisha and brought immense wealth to the Ganga treasury.<sup>1</sup>

### 1.2 The Construction Imperative: Devotion and Dominion

The construction of the Sun Temple at Konark, initiated around 1243 CE and continuing until roughly 1255 CE, must be viewed through this lens of military triumph.<sup>10</sup> The temple served a dual purpose that was simultaneously theological and political.

First, it was a _Jayastambha_ (Pillar of Victory) in the guise of a temple. By dedicating the grandest structure in the realm to Surya, the dispeller of darkness and the source of vitality, Narasimhadeva I was attributing his martial success to divine favor. In Hindu Vedic iconography, Surya is often associated with royalty and power, making him the ideal patron deity for a warrior-king.<sup>9</sup>

Second, the project was an assertion of economic and logistical supremacy. Historical estimates suggest that the construction consumed twelve years of the kingdom's entire revenue.<sup>1</sup> Mobilizing a workforce of 1,200 artisans, architects, and stone masons for over a decade required a surplus economy and a highly organized state apparatus. The ability to quarry stones from Nilagiri (80 km away), transport them via river barges, and lift multiton blocks to heights exceeding 200 feet demonstrated to both subjects and rivals that the Ganga state possessed unrivaled stability and resourcefulness.<sup>11</sup>

### 1.3 The Architects and the Workforce

The sheer scale of Konark required a regimented hierarchy of labor. The chief architect, often identified in oral traditions as **Bisu Maharana**, presided over a guild of specialized craftsmen.<sup>12</sup>

- **Sutradharas:** The holders of the thread, responsible for the geometric layout and measurements.
- **Shilpins:** The master sculptors who carved the intricate reliefs of dancers, musicians, and deities.
- **Ojhahs:** The blacksmiths responsible for forging the massive iron beams used as lintels-a metallurgical feat unique to Odishan architecture.<sup>10</sup>

The project was not merely a construction site but a temporary city. The legend that "no worker was allowed to go home for twelve years" <sup>13</sup> reflects the intensity of the undertaking. The pressure to complete the temple was immense, driven by the King's desire to consecrate the shrine before his death or perhaps before a specific astrological alignment. This intense pressure cooker environment likely birthed the famous legend of Dharmapada, the child prodigy who sacrificed himself to save the guild, a story that remains central to the temple's lore.<sup>12</sup>

## Part II: Sthala Purana - The Sacred Geography and Mythology

While history provides the dates and kings, the spiritual legitimacy of Konark is derived from its _Sthala Purana_ (local religious history). The site is known in scriptures as _Arka-kshetra_ (The Field of the Sun) or _Padma-kshetra_ (The Lotus Field), one of the four holy corners of Odisha's sacred geometry (the others being Puri, Bhubaneswar, and Jajpur).<sup>14</sup>

### 2.1 The Legend of Samba and the Curse of Krishna

The foundational myth of Konark is detailed in the _Samba Purana_, a text dedicated to solar worship, and the _Bhavishya Purana_.<sup>15</sup> The protagonist is Samba, the son of Lord Krishna and his wife Jambavati. Samba was renowned for his extraordinary beauty, which eventually led to his downfall.

The legend recounts that the sage Narada, known for his celestial machinations, tricked Samba into entering a bathing enclosure where Krishna's consorts (the Gopis or queens) were present. In other versions, Narada misled Krishna into believing Samba was acting inappropriately. Enraged by what he perceived as a violation of propriety, Krishna cursed his own son with leprosy (_Kustha_), a disease that would erode his legendary beauty.<sup>1</sup>

When the truth was revealed and Krishna's anger subsided, he realized he could not revoke the curse. He advised Samba to seek the favor of Surya, the Sun God, who is revered in the Vedas as the supreme healer of skin diseases (_Kustha-nashak_). Samba undertook a grueling penance for twelve years at **Mitravana** (the Forest of the Friend/Sun), located near the confluence of the Chandrabhaga River and the sea.<sup>1</sup>

### 2.2 The Discovery of the Idol and the Cure

Pleased by Samba's austerity, Surya appeared to him and cured him of leprosy. The following day, while bathing in the Chandrabhaga River, Samba discovered a self-manifested image of the Sun God seated on a lotus.<sup>14</sup> This discovery occurred on the seventh day of the bright half of the month of Magha (January-February), a date now celebrated as _Magha Saptami_ or _Ratha Saptami_.

Samba installed this idol in a small temple he built on the banks of the river, establishing the sanctity of the site. Thus, the Konark temple built by Narasimhadeva I in the 13th century is viewed as a monumental expansion of the original shrine established by Samba in the Dwapara Yuga.<sup>1</sup>

### 2.3 The Migration of the Maga Brahmins: Evidence of Globalization

One of the most fascinating aspects of the Konark _Sthala Purana_ is the involvement of the **Maga Brahmins** (also known as Sakaldwipiya or Bhojaka Brahmins). According to the _Bhavishya Purana_, after Samba built the temple, the local Brahmins of Odisha refused to perform the worship of the Surya idol. They argued that the idol's iconography-specifically the wearing of boots (_Udichya-vesha_) and a girdle (_Avyanga_)-was alien to Vedic traditions, where deities are typically barefoot.<sup>5</sup>

Samba was advised to bring special priests from **Shakadvipa** (the land of the Scythians, widely interpreted by scholars as Iran or Central Asia). Samba flew to Shakadvipa (mythologically on the back of Garuda) and brought eighteen families of Maga priests to Konark.<sup>6</sup>

This legend points to a historical migration of Zoroastrian or Persian sun-worshippers (Magi) to India, likely in waves during the first millennium CE. The iconography of the Konark Sun idol, which indeed depicts the deity wearing high Central Asian boots, corroborates this link.<sup>18</sup> This suggests that Konark was a melting pot of spiritual cultures, where indigenous Vedic rituals merged with Iranian solar cults to create a unique liturgical tradition.<sup>3</sup>

### 2.4 The Sacred River Chandrabhaga

The Chandrabhaga River is central to the holiness of Konark. In the _Samba Purana_, it is the site of the cure. Historically, it was a navigable branch of the Prachi river system that flowed into the Bay of Bengal, allowing ships to dock near the temple.<sup>9</sup>

Over the centuries, the river has silted up and the sea has receded. Today, the "river" is represented by a small, sacred pool near the beach. However, the spiritual memory of the river persists. Every year on _Magha Saptami_, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims gather at the Chandrabhaga beach to take a holy dip before sunrise, re-enacting Samba's cure. This festival, the _Chandrabhaga Mela_, is one of the largest religious gatherings in Odisha.<sup>14</sup>

## Part III: Architectural Analysis: The Chariot of Time

The Konark Sun Temple is the supreme achievement of the **Kalinga School of Architecture**. While it adheres to the basic curvilinear format of the _Nagara_ style (common in Northern India), it departs radically in its conceptual visualization. The entire temple is not just a housing for a deity; it is the deity's vehicle itself.<sup>4</sup>

### 3.1 The Temple Plan and Layout

The original complex consisted of three main structures aligned on an East-West axis:

- **The Vimana (Main Sanctum):** This massive tower housed the presiding deity. It is estimated to have stood 229 feet (70 meters) tall, making it the tallest temple in India at the time. It has since collapsed, leaving only the plinth and remnants of the walls.<sup>2</sup>
- **The Jagamohana (Assembly Hall):** This is the structure that survives today. Standing about 128 feet tall, it is a pyramidal roofed structure (_Pidha Deula_) standing on a high platform. It was the hall where devotees would gather to view the deity.<sup>21</sup>
- **The Nata Mandira (Dance Hall):** Located in front of the Jagamohana, this roofless hall stands on a high plinth and is covered in exquisite carvings of musicians and dancers, reflecting the vibrant tradition of Odissi dance that flourished in the temple.<sup>7</sup>

The entire complex is enclosed within a wall, with the main gateway (Gaja-Simha Dwara) facing East to welcome the rising sun.

### 3.2 The Colossal Chariot: Horses and Wheels

The temple is designed as a chariot of the Sun God, Surya, ready to take flight across the heavens.

- **The Horses:** Seven massive stone horses (mostly damaged now) are carved straining at their harness at the front of the temple. These represent the seven days of the week, the seven colors of the rainbow, or the seven meters of Sanskrit poetry (_Gayatri, Ushnik, Anushtubh, Brihati, Pankti, Trishtubh, and Jagati_).<sup>7</sup>
- **The Wheels:** Twenty-four giant wheels are carved into the sides of the platform. These wheels are the defining feature of Konark. Each wheel is approximately 9 feet 9 inches in diameter, with 8 major spokes and 8 minor spokes.<sup>7</sup>

### 3.3 The Wheels as Astronomical Instruments (Sundials)

The wheels of Konark are not merely decorative; they are sophisticated timekeeping devices (sundials) that demonstrate the advanced astronomical knowledge of 13th-century Odisha.

**Table 1: Reading the Konark Sundial**

| **Feature** | **Representation** | **Time Calculation Logic** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **24 Wheels** | 24 Hours / Fortnights | Represent the 24 hours of the day or the 24 fortnights (_Pakshas_) of the Hindu lunar year. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **8 Major Spokes** | 8 _Prahars_ (Time units) | A day (24 hours) is divided into 8 _Prahars_ of 3 hours each. The gap between two major spokes equals 3 hours (180 minutes). |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **8 Minor Spokes** | Half-_Prahars_ | Located exactly between major spokes, dividing the 3-hour segment into two 90-minute segments. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **30 Beads** | Minute Indicators | Between a major and minor spoke (90 mins), there are 30 beads. **90 ÷ 30 = 3 minutes per bead.** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bead Shape** | Fine Tuning | The beads are shaped to allow reading of the shadow at the center or edge, offering accuracy down to the minute. |
| --- | --- | --- |

Source: Analysis of.<sup>7</sup>

The wheels operate anti-clockwise. To tell the time, one observes the shadow cast by the axle on the rim. If the shadow falls on a bead, one counts the beads from the preceding major spoke to calculate the exact minute. The top spoke represents midnight or noon depending on the wheel's position. This integration of function and form-where the architecture itself measures the cosmic entity it worships-is unique to Konark.<sup>26</sup>

### 3.4 Engineering Marvels: Iron and Stone

The construction of Konark challenged the limits of medieval engineering.

- **Stone Types:**
  - **Khondalite:** A weather-resistant but porous reddish sandstone used for the main superstructure. It was quarried and transported by river rafts.<sup>11</sup>
  - **Chlorite:** A hard, dark stone used for the door jambs and the most delicate sculptures (like the famous drummer figures).
  - **Laterite:** Used for the foundation core.<sup>27</sup>
- **Wrought Iron Beams:** The most baffling feature for modern engineers is the use of massive iron beams to support the lintels of the doorways. Some of these beams weigh several tons. Metallurgical analysis reveals they are made of wrought iron, forged by beating heated metal rather than casting. The fact that these beams have resisted corrosion for nearly 800 years in a saline coastal environment indicates a lost knowledge of corrosion resistance, possibly involving a high phosphorous content or a specific slag coating.<sup>7</sup>
- **Dry Masonry:** No mortar was used. The stones were held together by gravity and a system of iron dowels and clamps. The precision of the cutting was such that a sheet of paper could not pass between the joints.<sup>7</sup>

## Part IV: Iconography and Sculpture

The sculpture of Konark is described by art historians as a riot of life. Every inch of the surface is carved, depicting everything from the divine to the mundane, the martial to the erotic.

### 4.1 The Erotic Sculptures (Maithuna)

Konark, like Khajuraho, is famous for its erotic sculptures (_Maithuna_). These images depict couples in various acts of intimacy. Several theories explain their presence:

- **Tantric Influence:** Odisha was a stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism and Tantric Hinduism, which view sexual union as a metaphor for the union of the human soul (_Atman_) with the divine (_Brahman_). The images might serve as a test of a devotee's detachment.<sup>7</sup>
- **Protection from Lightning:** A folk belief held that images of union (creation) would protect the temple from lightning (destruction) and the wrath of Indra.<sup>28</sup>
- **Celebration of Life:** In the Hindu worldview, _Kama_ (desire) is one of the four goals of life (_Purusharthas_), alongside _Dharma_ (duty), _Artha_ (wealth), and _Moksha_ (liberation). The temple exterior represents the world of desire, which one must transcend to enter the sanctum.<sup>28</sup>

### 4.2 War and Daily Life

The base of the temple features friezes depicting the life of the King and his subjects.

- **War Elephants:** The famous "War Elephant" sculpture depicts a massive pachyderm picking up a soldier with its trunk, symbolizing the might of the Ganga army.<sup>7</sup>
- **Giraffe:** A relief depicting a giraffe is significant as it indicates trade relations with Africa or Arab traders who brought such exotic animals to the Odishan court.<sup>7</sup>
- **The Sun Cult:** Images of Surya in three forms-morning (youthful), mid-day (mature), and evening (weary)-adorn the niches, capturing the cycle of the day.

## Part V: Legends of Construction and Collapse

The history of Konark is inextricably bound with legends that attempt to explain its ambitious construction and its mysterious collapse.

### 5.1 The Legend of Dharmapada

This is the most poignant and widely cited story associated with Konark. It speaks to the themes of genius, sacrifice, and the conflict between the old guard and the new generation.

The Narrative:

After twelve years of labor, the 1,200 artisans led by the chief architect Bisu Maharana were unable to complete the temple. Specifically, they could not mount the Kalasa or Dadhi-nauti (the crowning stone/finial) atop the main tower. Every attempt resulted in the stones collapsing. King Narasimhadeva I, frustrated by the delay and the draining treasury, issued a decree: if the temple was not completed by the next sunrise, all 1,200 artisans would be beheaded.12

That night, a 12-year-old boy named **Dharmapada** arrived at the camp. He was Bisu Maharana's son, whom the father had never seen as he had been away at the construction site since the boy's birth. Dharmapada, having studied the temple architecture manuscripts at home, identified the flaw in the alignment. He climbed the tower and, under the cover of darkness, successfully positioned the crowning stone, completing the temple.<sup>13</sup>

However, the artisans were gripped by fear. They reasoned that if the King learned a child had succeeded where the master craftsmen failed, their reputation would be ruined, and they might still be punished for incompetence. To save the honor and lives of his father and the 1,200 members of his guild, Dharmapada climbed to the top of the Vimana and jumped into the churning waters of the sea (or the river Chandrabhaga) below, killing himself.<sup>12</sup>

Significance:

This story is deeply embedded in the Odia psyche. It is often used to illustrate the supreme sacrifice of the individual for the community (Samaja). The phrase "Barasha sata badhei na Dharmapada?" (Twelve hundred artisans or Dharmapada?) is a common rhetorical question in Odisha, asking whether the collective interest outweighs the individual genius.

### 5.2 The Mystery of the Floating Idol and the Magnets

Another enduring legend concerns the main idol of Surya. It is believed that the idol was made of a material rich in iron (possibly meteoritic ore) and was suspended in mid-air inside the sanctum.<sup>10</sup>

The Mechanism:

The legend posits that the temple was built with massive magnets. The Dadhi-nauti (capstone) was a 52-ton lodestone (natural magnet), and other magnets were embedded in the floor and walls. The interplay of these magnetic fields held the iron idol in levitation, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle for devotees.10

The Collapse:

The legend continues that the magnetic power of the temple was so strong that it disrupted the compasses of European ships sailing in the Bay of Bengal, leading to shipwrecks. Portuguese sailors, identifying the temple as the source of the trouble, purportedly landed and stole the massive lodestone from the top. The removal of this keystone magnet destabilized the magnetic balance, causing the iron beams and the idol to crash, leading to the gradual structural collapse of the main tower.10

Scientific Reality:

Modern analysis suggests that while the use of iron dowels and beams is real, stable magnetic levitation of such a heavy object (Earnshaw's Theorem) would require diamagnetic materials (like bismuth) and precise active stabilization, which is unlikely for the 13th century. However, the presence of magnetic rocks (Khondalite with iron content) can indeed deflect compasses, which may have birthed the legend.33

### 5.3 The Legend of Kalapahad

The destruction of Konark is also attributed to **Kalapahad**, a general of the Bengal Sultanate (Sulaiman Karrani) in the 16th century. According to the _Madala Panji_, Kalapahad invaded Odisha in 1568 CE and embarked on a campaign of iconoclasm. He is said to have damaged the _Kalasa_ of the Konark temple and marred the lotus emblem, violating the sanctuary.<sup>31</sup> Legend has it that he attempted to destroy the temple but was thwarted by the goddess Ramachandi, who deceived him before vanishing. Frustrated, he managed only to damage the main tower, initiating the structural decline that led to its eventual fall.<sup>35</sup>

## Part VI: Location Details and Sacred Environment

### 6.1 Geographical Setting

Konark is located at **19.8876° N, 86.0945° E** in the Puri district of Odisha. It forms the third point of Odisha's "Golden Triangle" of tourism, the other two being Puri (35 km away) and Bhubaneswar (65 km away).<sup>2</sup>

The landscape has changed dramatically since the 13th century.

- **Receding Coastline:** Geological evidence suggests that during the temple's construction, the sea was within splashing distance of the enclosure walls. Today, the Bay of Bengal has receded approximately 2 to 3 kilometers away.<sup>2</sup> This recession likely contributed to the abandonment of the site as a port, cutting off its economic lifeline.
- **The Marine Drive:** The road connecting Puri to Konark (Marine Drive) runs parallel to the beach and through the Balukhand-Konark Wildlife Sanctuary, offering a scenic approach characterized by casuarina forests and spotted deer.<sup>36</sup>

### 6.2 Ramachandi Temple

Located about 7 km from Konark on the Marine Drive is the temple of Goddess Ramachandi. She is considered the presiding deity of the Konark region. Legends say she left the main Sun Temple to avoid the desecration by Kalapahad. It is a popular picnic spot located where the Kushabhadra River flows into the Bay of Bengal.<sup>14</sup>

## Part VII: Conservation History

The survival of the _Jagamohana_ (Assembly Hall) is due to a drastic conservation measure taken during the British Raj.

### 7.1 The Sand Filling (1903)

By the late 19th century, the _Jagamohana_ was on the verge of collapse. Stones were falling from the ceiling, and the structure was unstable. In 1903, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Sir John Woodburn, authorized a bold plan. The interior of the hall was completely filled with sand and sealed off with a 15-foot thick stone wall. This internal sand packing provided the counter-pressure needed to hold the walls in place, effectively saving the structure but making the interior inaccessible forever.<sup>37</sup>

### 7.2 Modern Conservation (ASI)

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) currently maintains the site.

- **Paper Pulp Cleaning:** To combat the erosion caused by salt-laden winds, the ASI uses a "paper pulp" method. A poultice of wet paper pulp is applied to the stone sculptures. As it dries, it absorbs the soluble salts from the stone pores. The dried pulp is then peeled off, removing the harmful salts without abrasive scrubbing.<sup>38</sup>
- **Stone Replacement:** Where the original Khondalite has completely eroded, ASI replaces it with plain blocks of similar stone, deliberately leaving them uncarved to distinguish modern repairs from the original 13th-century artistry.<sup>39</sup>
- **Future Plans:** As of 2025, there are ongoing discussions and endoscopic studies to assess the condition of the sand filling and whether it is safe to remove it to reveal the interior sculptures, though no action has been taken yet due to structural risks.<sup>37</sup>

## Part VIII: Visitor Details (2025 Guide)

Visiting Konark in 2025 requires planning to navigate the crowds and the climate.

### 8.1 Entry Fees and Timings

### 8.4 The Konark Dance Festival

Held annually from **December 1st to 5th**, this is a cultural highlight.

- **Venue:** An open-air auditorium built against the backdrop of the illuminated Sun Temple.
- **Performances:** Classical dance forms like Odissi, Bharatanatyam, Manipuri, and Kathak are performed by India's leading artists.
- **Atmosphere:** The festival celebrates the "frozen music" of Konark's sculptures with the "living music" of dance.<sup>48</sup>
- **Sand Art Festival:** Simultaneously, the International Sand Art Festival is held at Chandrabhaga Beach (3 km away), featuring artists creating massive sculptures from sand.<sup>48</sup>

## Conclusion

The Konark Sun Temple is a monument that defies the erosion of time, much like the sun it worships. It stands as a testament to the ambition of King Narasimhadeva I, the genius of the architect Bisu Maharana, and the sacrifice of the boy Dharmapada.

Analyzing Konark reveals a society that was scientifically advanced enough to turn a temple into a chronometer, metallurgically skilled enough to forge rust-proof iron, and artistically bold enough to cover a sacred shrine with the full spectrum of human life, from the carnal to the divine.

While the main tower has fallen-victim to the shifting sands, the salt winds, or perhaps the removal of its magnetic heart-the _Jagamohana_ remains. It continues to draw millions who come not just to see a ruin, but to witness a prayer carved in stone, a chariot that remains eternally poised to carry the Sun God across the sky.

**Key Analytical Insights:**

- **The Chariot Metaphor:** The temple is not a static building but a dynamic vehicle; the wheels are functional instruments of time, merging architecture with astronomy.
- **Global Integration:** The legend of the Maga Brahmins and the iconography of the booted Sun God prove that 13th-century Odisha was part of a wider trans-regional network connecting to Persia and Central Asia.
- **Engineering vs. Geology:** The collapse was likely an engineering failure caused by the "floating pile" effect in liquefiable sandy soil, exacerbated by the sheer weight of the 229-foot tower, rather than purely iconoclastic destruction.
- **Cultural Memory:** The persistence of the Dharmapada legend highlights the cultural value placed on collective honor over individual survival in Odia society.
