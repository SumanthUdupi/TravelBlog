            <h2>The Call of the Conch</h2>
            <p>
                It began not with a plan, but with a pull. Odisha, the land of Kalinga, is not merely a destination on a map; it is a spiritual magnetic field.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Jai Jagannath!" is more than a greeting here—it is the rhythm of life itself. Between the ancient stones and the modern chaos, a timeless narrative waits to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the tribal roots of the Iron Age to the futuristic prophecies of the Malika, this is the story of a pilgrimage through time.

            <h2>Ekamra Kshetra: The City of Temples</h2>
            <p>
                Bhubaneswar. Once home to 7,000 temples, it is a testament to the Kalingan architects who wrote poetry in stone.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the <strong>Lingaraj Temple</strong>, Shiva and Vishnu merge into Harihara, a syncretic masterpiece 180 feet high. The very air vibrates with the chanting of mantras that have echoed here for a thousand years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nearby, the <strong>Rajarani Temple</strong> stands without a deity, a monument to love itself, carved with feminine grace in every niche.

            <h2>The Mystic North: Shakti & Prophecy</h2>
            <p>
                Leaving the city of Shiva, we ventured north into the lands of Shakti. In Cuttack, the <strong>Chandi Temple</strong> guards the Silver City, her presence unearthed from mounds of red sindoor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further still, at <strong>Chhatia Bata</strong>, time bends. This is the fortress of the future, where the <em>Bhavishya Malika</em> prophecies speak of the end of the Kali Yuga.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, the sword of the Lord is said to be slowly growing, inch by inch, awaiting the final battle.

            <h2>Konark: The Wheel of Time</h2>
            <p>
                Rising from the sands like a colossus, the <strong>Konark Sun Temple</strong> is a chariot for the Sun God, Surya. Seven horses pull it; twenty-four wheels carry it.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are not mere carvings. They are time machines. To this day, the shadow of the hub falls precisely on the spokes to tell time to the minute.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a reminder that in Odisha, science and spirituality were never separate.

            <p>
                All roads lead to <strong>Sri Kshetra</strong>—Puri. Here resides the Lord of the Universe, Jagannath, with his siblings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Curiously, they are incomplete forms—no hands, no feet. They are the <em>Darubrahma</em> (Wooden Absolute). They need no hands to hold you, no feet to walk with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we stood before the Patitapabana flag flying against the wind, the logic of the mind surrendered to the wisdom of the heart.

            <h2>The Return</h2>
            <p>
                We returned with dust on our feet but clarity in our souls.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Odyssey is not over. It lives in every "Jai Jagannath" whispered, in every sunrise over Konark, and in the silence of the caves.
