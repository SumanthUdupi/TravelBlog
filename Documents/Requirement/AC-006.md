# AC-006: Content Moderation

Status: ENHANCED

## Overview
As a Product Owner, I need robust administrative tools for reviewing and managing flagged content to maintain platform quality and community standards. This acceptance criteria defines the moderation workflow from user flagging through admin review and action, ensuring efficient content governance while protecting user rights.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Scenario 1: Flagging content**
```
GIVEN a reader views a post with inappropriate content
WHEN they click "Flag" button
THEN:
  ✓ Modal opens with reasons: Spam, Harassment, Misinformation
  ✓ Selecting reason submits flag to moderation_flags table
  ✓ Author not notified immediately
```

**Scenario 2: Admin review**
```
GIVEN admin logs into moderation dashboard
WHEN they view pending flags
THEN:
  ✓ List shows post title, flag reason, severity
  ✓ Clicking "Review" opens post in read-only mode
  ✓ Actions: Approve (dismiss flag), Delete post, Ban user
  ✓ Decision logged in audit table
```
