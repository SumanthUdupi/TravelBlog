As a dedicated travel content reader, I need intelligent reading streak tracking to maintain my daily reading habit, with visual progress indicators, milestone rewards, and social sharing to encourage consistent engagement with travel blogs.

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement Increase**: 30% rise in daily active readers

## Technical Considerations
