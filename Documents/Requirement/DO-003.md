# DO-003: Incident Response

Status: ENHANCED

## Overview
As an Operations Manager, I need a comprehensive incident response framework that ensures rapid detection, assessment, and resolution of system incidents affecting the TravelBlog platform, minimizing impact on user experience and maintaining platform reliability. This requirement establishes the operational procedures for handling unexpected events while protecting user data and travel content.

## Business Value
Effective incident response protects the platform's reputation, ensures continuous availability of travel content, and maintains user trust. It directly supports business continuity by minimizing downtime, reducing financial losses from outages, and demonstrating commitment to service quality that differentiates the platform in the competitive travel content market.

## Target Audience
- Primary: On-call engineers and incident response team members
- Secondary: Platform administrators and DevOps engineers
- Tertiary: Product managers and executive stakeholders requiring status updates

## Value Propositions
- **Rapid Resolution**: Structured processes minimize mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- **Communication Excellence**: Transparent stakeholder communication maintains trust during incidents
- **Learning Culture**: Post-mortem analysis drives continuous improvement and prevents recurrence
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Documented procedures ensure adherence to data protection and service level agreements

## Revenue Model
Supports revenue protection through:
- **Uptime Maintenance**: Ensures premium subscribers and paying advertisers experience minimal disruptions
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrates reliability that encourages conversions from free to paid tiers
- **Cost Control**: Prevents revenue loss from extended outages and compensations

## Success Metrics
- **Detection Time**: <5 minutes average time to detect critical incidents
- **Response Time**: <15 minutes average time to initial response and triage
- **Resolution Time**: <2 hours for P1 incidents, <8 hours for P2 incidents
- **Communication Quality**: >95% stakeholder satisfaction with incident communications
- **Recurrence Rate**: <10% of incidents classified as repeat issues
- **Post-mortem Completion**: 100% of major incidents have documented post-mortems within 48 hours

## Visual/Interactive Specifications
- **Incident Dashboard**:
  - Real-time incident timeline with severity indicators and status updates
  - Interactive communication log with stakeholder notifications and responses
  - Resource allocation tracker showing team assignments and workload distribution
- **Status Page Interface**:
  - Public-facing status page with real-time updates and incident history
  - Subscriber notification system for status page updates
  - Historical uptime statistics and incident trends
- **Post-mortem Portal**:
  - Interactive timeline reconstruction of incident events
  - Collaborative editing for root cause analysis and action items
  - Automated follow-up tracking for remediation tasks

## Technical Considerations
- **Alerting Systems**: Integration with monitoring tools (DataDog, New Relic, PagerDuty) for automated incident detection
- **Communication Platforms**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, or similar for real-time coordination
- **Runbook Automation**: Executable runbooks with automated remediation steps where possible
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated logging and evidence gathering during incidents
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for incident response actions and data access
- **Integration APIs**: Webhooks and APIs for seamless tool integration
- **Compliance Logging**: Audit trails for all incident response actions and communications

## Implementation Notes
- **MVP Response Plan**: Start with basic alerting, manual triage, and communication procedures
- **Tool Integration**: Implement PagerDuty and Slack integration for notification and coordination
- **Runbook Development**: Create initial runbooks for common scenarios (database issues, CDN failures)
- **Training Program**: Establish regular incident response drills and training sessions
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implement feedback loops from post-mortems to prevent future incidents

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Alert Fatigue**: Too many false positives reduce response effectiveness - Mitigation: Fine-tune alerting thresholds and implement alert routing
- **Communication Breakdown**: Poor information flow during crises - Mitigation: Standardized communication templates and escalation procedures
- **Skill Gaps**: Team lacks expertise for complex incidents - Mitigation: Regular training, cross-training, and external expert access
- **Scope Creep**: Incidents expand beyond initial assessment - Mitigation: Clear incident classification and escalation criteria
- **Legal/Compliance Issues**: Inadequate documentation for regulatory requirements - Mitigation: Automated logging and compliance-focused procedures
