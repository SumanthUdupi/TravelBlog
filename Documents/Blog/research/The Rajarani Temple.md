# The Rajarani Temple of Bhubaneswar: A Monograph on the Indresvara Shrine

## 1\. Introduction: The Gem of Ekamra Kshetra

In the dense architectural tapestry of Bhubaneswar, Odisha-historically revered as _Ekamra Kshetra_, the "Mango Grove of the One Lord"-the Rajarani Temple stands as a singular, enigmatic masterpiece. Constructed in the mid-11th century CE, this edifice represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Kalinga School of architecture, marking a transition from the nascent experimentalism of the earlier Somavamsi phase to the colossal grandeur of the later Imperial Ganga period.<sup>1</sup> Unlike the towering dominance of the Lingaraja Temple or the enclosed, intimate sanctity of the Mukteswara, the Rajarani Temple is celebrated for its sculptural exuberance, its unique architectural experimentation with the _anga-shikharas_ (miniature spires), and the profound mystery surrounding its deconsecrated status.

The temple is popularly known today as "Rajarani," a nomenclature that evokes romantic images of royalty but is, in reality, derived from the lithology of its construction material. The edifice is built from a distinct variety of reddish-gold sandstone locally termed _rajarania_ stone. This geogenic attribute imbues the monument with a warm, amber glow that shifts in intensity with the movement of the sun, distinguishing it visually from the grey sandstone and laterite structures that populate the rest of the temple city.<sup>1</sup>

However, the significance of the Rajarani Temple extends far beyond its chromatic appeal. It serves as a lithic document of the cultural and political synthesis that occurred during the Somavamsi dynasty's rule. The architecture betrays a conscious dialogue with the Central Indian Nagara style, specifically the temples of Khajuraho, suggesting a period of intense artistic exchange. Furthermore, the temple's exterior walls serve as a veritable encyclopedia of medieval iconography, hosting what art historians consider the finest extant set of _Dikpalas_ (Guardians of the Directions) in Eastern India.<sup>5</sup>

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Rajarani Temple. It dissects the monument's historical origins under King Indraratha, analyzes its structural mechanics and adherence to the _Shilpa Shastras_, explores the rich tapestry of its _Sthala Purana_ (local legends), and offers a detailed guide for the contemporary visitor and researcher. Through this deep examination, the report posits that the Rajarani Temple is not merely a "Love Temple" as touted by modern tourism, but a sophisticated theological and architectural statement on the nature of divinity, beauty, and the cosmic order.

## 2\. Historical Background and Dynastic Context

To fully appreciate the Rajarani Temple, one must situate it within the political and cultural efflorescence of medieval Odisha. The temple belongs to the mature phase of the Kalinga architectural tradition, a period characterized by increased verticality, elaborate ornamentation, and the standardization of the temple complex.

### 2.1 The Somavamsi Hegemony

The construction of the Rajarani Temple is attributed to the **Somavamsi Dynasty** (also known as the Panduvamsis of Kosala or the Kesaris in local legends), who ruled parts of present-day Odisha from the 9th to the early 12th centuries.<sup>7</sup> The Somavamsis were instrumental in unifying the regions of _Dakshina Kosala_ (Western Odisha) and _Utkala_ (Coastal Odisha), creating a political stability that allowed art and architecture to flourish.

This unification was not merely territorial but cultural. The Somavamsis are believed to have migrated from Central India to the coastal region. This migration path provides a plausible conduit for architectural ideas to travel, explaining the Central Indian influences observed in the Rajarani's design.<sup>3</sup> The dynasty presided over a "Golden Age" of temple building in Bhubaneswar, bridging the gap between the earlier Bhauma-Kara dynasty and the later Eastern Gangas.

### 2.2 The Patronage of King Indraratha

Scholarly consensus and textual analysis date the Rajarani Temple to the **mid-11th century CE** (c. 1000-1050 CE).<sup>1</sup> This placement is significant as it positions the temple chronologically between the Mukteswara Temple (10th century, marking the transition from the early to the mature phase) and the Lingaraja Temple (later 11th century, representing the zenith of the style).

Historical evidence points to the temple originally being consecrated as the **Indresvara** temple. The etymology of "Indresvara" strongly implies that it was commissioned by the Somavamsi ruler **Indraratha**.<sup>1</sup> King Indraratha was a significant figure in the dynasty, although his reign was marked by severe external threats. He faced invasions from the Paramaras of Malwa and the Cholas of the south. The Chola Emperor Rajendra Chola I's inscriptions mention the defeat of Indraratha at Adinagar (modern-day Jajpur), providing a fixed historical anchor for his reign.<sup>7</sup>

Despite the turbulence of his rule, the patronage of such a sophisticated temple suggests that the royal treasury and the guild of artisans were still operating at peak capacity. The Indresvara temple was likely intended to be a royal chapel or a votive shrine dedicated to Shiva, the tutelary deity of the Somavamsis, to ensure the spiritual protection of the realm during these tumultuous times.

### 2.3 The Religious Landscape: Shaivism and Synthesis

The 11th century in Odisha was an era of religious synthesis. The Somavamsi rulers were devout Shaivites (worshippers of Shiva), and Bhubaneswar was the epicenter of the Pashupata sect of Shaivism. This sectarian affiliation is clearly stamped on the Rajarani Temple through the image of **Lakulisha** (the founder of the Pashupata sect) carved on the lintel of the entrance.<sup>2</sup>

However, the art of the period also reflects a softening of rigid sectarian divides. The Rajarani temple, while Shaivite, is celebrated for its celebration of the feminine form (_Alasa Kanyas_) and the inclusion of diverse deities in its iconographic program. This aesthetic focus suggests a culture that valued _Sringara Rasa_ (the erotic sentiment) and beauty as pathways to the divine, a concept that would later culminate in the Vaishnavite lyricism of the _Gita Govinda_ in the 12th century. The temple stands at this crossroads, embodying the robust asceticism of the Pashupatas alongside the burgeoning aestheticism of the medieval courts.<sup>3</sup>

## 3\. Shala Purana: Legends, Myths, and Oral Traditions

In the context of Indian temple studies, _Sthala Purana_ (often colloquially referred to as Shala Purana) denotes the body of local legends, myths, and religious history associated with a specific sacred site (_sthala_). Unlike the _Maha Puranas_ (universal texts like the Shiva Purana), Sthala Puranas are deeply localized, explaining the origin of a specific deity, the sanctity of a specific pond, or the reason for a temple's unique characteristics.<sup>11</sup>

For the Rajarani Temple, the Sthala Purana is fragmented and reconstructed from oral traditions, the _Ekamra Purana_ text, and the architectural silence of the empty sanctum.

### 3.1 The Legend of Indresvara

The primary "textual" legend comes from the _Ekamra Purana_, a Sanskrit text detailing the sacred geography of Bhubaneswar. The text mentions a temple named **Indresvara** located to the east of the Siddheswara temple. Geographically, the Rajarani temple fits this description perfectly.<sup>9</sup>

According to this tradition, the temple was established by the King of the Gods, Indra (or a human king named Indraratha equating himself with Indra), to worship Lord Shiva. The association with Indra is significant because the _Dikpala_ Indra is given a prominent position on the eastern facade of the temple, reinforcing the textual link.<sup>5</sup> This legend validates the temple's status as a genuine place of worship, countering later folklore that dismissed it as a secular structure.

### 3.2 The "Pleasure Garden" Myth

A persistent local legend, fueled by the temple's modern name "Rajarani," claims that the structure was never a temple at all. Popular folklore suggests it was a **Pleasure Garden** (_Vihara_) or a resort for a Somavamsi King (_Raja_) and his Queen (_Rani_).<sup>7</sup>

Proponents of this myth point to two features:

- **The Absence of a Deity:** The sanctum is empty, leading to the belief that no god ever resided there.
- **The Erotic Imagery:** The profusion of _mithuna_ (amorous couples) and beautiful women on the walls is misinterpreted as secular decoration for a royal pleasure house rather than sacred symbolism.

However, historians and archaeologists reject this "Pleasure Garden" theory. The presence of the _Navagrahas_ (Nine Planets) on the lintels and the _Dikpalas_ (Guardians) on the walls are strict liturgical requirements for a Hindu temple, not a palace. The "Raja-Rani" name is definitively proven to be a reference to the stone type, not the inhabitants.<sup>1</sup> The legend, however, adds a layer of romantic mystique that continues to draw tourists.

### 3.3 The Legend of the Unconsecrated Shrine

The most critical question in the temple's Sthala Purana is: _Why is the sanctum empty?_

There are several prevailing theories and legends:

- **The Death of the Patron:** One tradition holds that King Indraratha died (possibly in the war with the Cholas) before the _Prana Pratistha_ (consecration ceremony) could be performed. In Hindu tradition, a temple left unconsecrated for a certain period becomes unfit for later consecration.<sup>9</sup>
- **The Defilement:** Another oral tradition suggests the temple was defiled by invaders or non-believers during its construction phase, rendering it ritually impure.
- **The Shift in Dynastic Fortunes:** With the fall of the Somavamsis and the rise of the Gangas, the incomplete Indresvara shrine may have been abandoned in favor of the newer, grander project of the Lingaraja Temple.

### 3.4 Clarification on "Curse" Legends (Thanjavur vs. Bhubaneswar)

It is imperative to correct a common misconception found in modern digital folklore. Some sources confuse the Rajarani Temple with the **Brihadeeswara Temple** in Thanjavur (built by Raja Raja Chola). Legends about a "curse" on politicians entering the main gate, or the death of the architect, belong to the Thanjavur temple.<sup>13</sup> There is no historical or legendary evidence of a "political curse" associated with the Rajarani Temple in Odisha. The "curse" of Rajarani is simply the silence of its empty sanctum, a spiritual void amidst architectural plenty.

## 4\. Architectural Analysis: The Morphology of the Rekha Deul

The Rajarani Temple is a masterclass in the _Kalinga_ style of architecture, specifically the _Rekha Deul_ order used for the sanctum. However, it introduces a dramatic innovation-the _Anga-shikhara_-which sets it apart from every other temple in the region.

### 4.1 The Plan: Pancharatha to Saptaratha Evolution

The temple stands on a raised platform (_pitha_) of three mouldings, a feature that adds monumentality and separates the sacred space from the mundane ground level.<sup>8</sup>

The ground plan of the _Vimana_ (Sanctum) is technically **pancharatha** (five-chariot plan). This means the wall is divided into five vertical segments or projections (_rathas_) on each side:

- **Raha:** The central, widest projection.
- **Anuratha:** The intermediate projections flanking the central one.
- **Kanika:** The corner projections.

However, the Rajarani architects utilized a sophisticated technique known as "emergent expansion" or "progressive multiplication".<sup>16</sup> The projections are so deeply recessed and complex that the square plan appears almost circular or star-shaped. By the time the projections reach the upper levels of the spire, the faceting increases, creating a **saptaratha** (seven-projection) effect in certain registers.<sup>1</sup> This multi-faceted plan serves a dual purpose: it increases the surface area available for sculpture and creates a dynamic interplay of light and shadow that animates the stone.

### 4.2 Vertical Elevation: The Five-Fold Division

The vertical rise of the temple follows the standard Odishan division into five parts (_Panchanga Bada_), a hallmark of the mature style:

- **Pabhaga (Base):** The lowermost section consists of five decorative mouldings: _Khura_ (hoof), _Kumbha_ (pitcher), _Patta_, _Kani_ (pointed edge), and _Basanta_. These mouldings connect the structure to the earth and are richly carved with scrollwork.<sup>9</sup>
- **Tala Jangha (Lower Wall):** This vertical wall section houses the famous _Dikpalas_ and _Khakhara-mundis_ (miniature shrines).
- **Bandhana (Bonding):** A set of three mouldings that separates the lower and upper walls.
- **Upara Jangha (Upper Wall):** This section houses erotic couples (_Mithunas_) and _Alasa Kanyas_ (maidens) in _Pidha-mundi_ niches.<sup>9</sup>
- **Baranda (Cornice):** A set of seven mouldings that marks the transition from the wall to the spire.

### 4.3 The Gandi and the Anga-Shikhara Anomaly

The most defining characteristic of the Rajarani temple is its _Gandi_ (superstructure or spire). In the standard Odishan style (e.g., Mukteswara or Lingaraja), the spire is a continuous curvilinear outline marked by horizontal grooves (_bhumis_).

The Rajarani, however, adopts a **cluster theory**. The main spire (_mula-manjari_) is surrounded by clusters of miniature spires known as **Anga-shikharas**.<sup>9</sup>

- **The Mechanism:** These miniature towers spring from the base of the spire, clinging to the main body.
- **The Hierarchy:** There are multiple levels of these turrets. The lowest level features fully emerged, nearly free-standing aedicules. The middle level features half-emerged turrets (_urushringas_), and the upper levels integrate back into the central mass.<sup>16</sup>
- **The Effect:** This arrangement gives the temple a "mountain-peak" appearance, resembling the Kailasa mountain. It softens the vertical profile, creating a rhythmic, cascading ascent.

**Comparative Insight:** This cluster arrangement is the primary evidence for the influence of the **Khajuraho** temples (Nagara style) on the Rajarani. The Kandariya Mahadev temple in Khajuraho uses the same _Sekhari_ mode of clustered spires. The Somavamsi architects, aware of these Central Indian trends, adapted them onto the Kalinga ground plan, creating a unique hybrid.<sup>8</sup>

### 4.4 The Jagamohana (Assembly Hall)

The _Jagamohana_ is a _Pidha Deul_ (pyramidal temple) with a square plan.

- **Roof:** It has a pyramidal roof composed of stepped horizontal tiers (_pidhas_), crowned by a _Kalasa_.
- **Decor:** Unlike the ornate sanctum, the Jagamohana is relatively plain. It was found in ruins in the 19th century and was extensively restored by the ASI in 1903, which likely accounts for the lack of intricate ornamentation.<sup>4</sup>
- **Windows:** It features balustraded windows on the north and south, adorned with carvings of musicians and dancers, illuminating the interior.<sup>1</sup>

## 5\. The Sculptural Program: A Lithic Encyclopedia

If the architecture of Rajarani is the skeleton, the sculpture is the flesh. The use of the fine-grained _rajarania_ sandstone allowed the sculptors to carve with the precision of ivory workers. The sculptural program is divided into three distinct categories: The Guardians (_Dikpalas_), The Maidens (_Alasa Kanyas_), and The Divine/Cult Images.

### 5.1 The Dikpalas: Guardians of the Cosmic Directions

The Rajarani Temple is globally renowned for possessing the most complete and artistically superior set of **Ashta Dikpalas** (Eight Guardians of the Directions) in the entire Odishan corpus. These figures are located on the corner projections (_kanika pagas_) of the lower _jangha_.<sup>5</sup> They are not merely static guards but dynamic portraits of divinity.

| **Direction** | **Deity** | **Attribute/Weapon** | **Vahana (Mount)** | **Iconographic Analysis** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **East** | **Indra** | Vajra (Thunderbolt), Ankusha (Goad) | Elephant | The King of Gods stands regally. The elephant is often depicted small, at his feet. His jewelry is royal and heavy. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **South-East** | **Agni** | Spear/Torch, Flames | Ram | The God of Fire. He is depicted as **Tundila** (pot-bellied) and bearded. Flames form a halo around his head, carved with exquisite detail.<sup>6</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **South** | **Yama** | Danda (Staff), Noose | Buffalo | The God of Death. He has a fearsome countenance, often with bristling hair, holding the staff of judgment. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **South-West** | **Nirriti** | Sword, Severed Head | Prostrate Man | The God of Decay/Misery. He stands over a lying figure (representing a corpse or ignorance). This is a rare depiction in such good condition.<sup>6</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **West** | **Varuna** | Pasha (Noose) | Makara (Crocodile) | The God of Oceans. This is often cited as the most beautiful sculpture. Varuna stands with a serene, almost feminine grace. He holds a noose symbolizing the binding of souls. The _Makara_ is carved with intricate scales.<sup>6</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **North-West** | **Vayu** | Banner/Flag | Deer | The God of Wind. He holds a fluttering banner, symbolizing the movement of air. The deer, a swift animal, reinforces the motif of speed.<sup>21</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **North** | **Kubera** | Vase of Gems | Horse / 7 Jars | The God of Wealth. He is pot-bellied (signifying prosperity) and stands above seven jars (_Nidhi_) overflowing with gems.<sup>6</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **North-East** | **Ishana** | Trident, Urdhvalinga | Bull (Nandi) | An aspect of Shiva. He is shown with an erect phallus (_urdhvalinga_), symbolizing potent creative energy, accompanied by an emaciated attendant.<sup>6</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### 5.2 Alasa Kanyas: The "Love Temple" Motif

The moniker "Love Temple" is derived from the profusion of **Alasa Kanyas** (Indolent Maidens) and **Nayikas** (Heroines) adorning the upper _jangha_ and the recesses. Following the canons of the _Shilpa Prakasha_, these figures serve an _apotropaic_ function-their beauty protects the temple from the "evil eye" and auspiciously energizes the structure.<sup>23</sup>

The sculptors captured these women in candid, fluid moments:

- **Darpana-dharini:** The woman looking into a mirror, adjusting her makeup.
- **Sukasarika:** The woman playing with a pet parrot or myna bird, often depicted perched on her hand or shoulder.
- **Nupura-padika:** The woman adjusting her anklet (_nupura_), a pose that allows the sculptor to highlight the curves of the hip and leg.
- **Matrumurti:** The mother fondling her child, representing the nurturing aspect of the feminine.
- **Salabhanjika:** The woman clutching the branch of a tree, a classic Indian motif symbolizing fertility and the connection between nature and the feminine.<sup>23</sup>

The figures are characterized by their tall, slender proportions, the _tribhanga_ (three-bend) posture, and elaborate coiffures (hair buns resembling seed vessels). The stone captures the tension of their twisted bodies and the softness of their flesh, a testament to the mastery of the Somavamsi artisans.<sup>23</sup>

### 5.3 Secular and Erotic Imagery

The _Mithuna_ (couple) images on the Rajarani are less explicit than those at Konark but are equally significant. They depict couples in various stages of courtship and intimacy. While often interpreted as "erotic," within the context of 11th-century Shaivism (influenced by Kaula Kapalika Tantrism), these images represented the union of _Purusha_ (consciousness) and _Prakriti_ (energy), leading to _Moksha_ (liberation).<sup>2</sup>

## 6\. Conservation, Materiality, and Current State

### 6.1 The Lithology: Rajarania Stone

The temple's distinct identity is geologically determined. It is built of **reddish-gold sandstone** (_rajarania_), unlike the **Khondalite** (weathered gneiss/laterite) used in the Lingaraja and Jagannath temples.<sup>4</sup>

- **Pros:** This sandstone is fine-grained and softer when freshly quarried, allowing for the intricate, jewelry-like carving of the _Dikpalas_ and _Nayikas_.
- **Cons:** It is more susceptible to erosion from wind and water compared to the harder laterite. However, the ASI notes that while there is moderate weathering, the sculptural integrity remains largely intact.<sup>4</sup>

### 6.2 Restoration History

The temple was in a state of severe disrepair in the late 19th century. The _Jagamohana_ had collapsed significantly.

- **1903 Restoration:** The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) undertook a massive restoration project in 1903. This stabilization saved the monument. The "plainness" of the Jagamohana is largely due to this restoration, where missing stones were replaced with plain blocks rather than conjectural carvings.<sup>4</sup>
- **Current Status:** Today, the temple stands in a well-maintained garden setting, protected as a monument of national importance.

## 7\. Location Details and Visitor Information (2025)

Casual tourists should stick to handheld shooting.<sup>32</sup>
- **Best Time to Visit:** **October to March**. The golden hour (6:00-7:00 AM or 4:30-5:30 PM) is critical for photographers to capture the "glowing" effect of the red sandstone.

### 7.3 The Rajarani Music Festival

The temple serves as the backdrop for one of India's premier classical music festivals, organized by the Department of Tourism, Odisha.

- **Dates:** Traditionally held from **January 8th to January 11th** (Confirmed for 2025).<sup>34</sup>
- **Genre:** Exclusively **Indian Classical Music** (Hindustani, Carnatic, and Odissi music). This focus distinguishes it from the Mukteswara Dance Festival (Odissi dance) held nearby.<sup>3</sup>
- **Experience:** The festival is held in the open-air lawns. The temple is illuminated with spotlights, creating a mesmerizing ambiance as maestros perform under the stars. It is a ticketless or nominally priced event open to the public, drawing connoisseurs from across the globe.<sup>3</sup>

## 8\. Comparative Analysis: Rajarani in the Pan-Indian Context

The Rajarani Temple is a crucial link in the chain of Indian art history.

| **Feature** | **Rajarani Temple (Odisha)** | **Kandariya Mahadev (Khajuraho)** | **Lingaraja Temple (Odisha)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spire Style** | **Hybrid:** Kalinga Rekha with _Anga-shikharas_ (Clusters). | **Sekhari:** Multi-spired, mountain-like cluster. | **Pure Kalinga:** Single curvilinear spire with minimal clustering. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Plan** | **Pancharatha** (projected to appear circular). | **Stellar** (Star-shaped) plan. | **Pancharatha** (Standard). |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Interiors** | Plain, unadorned. | Richly carved interiors. | Plain interiors. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Eroticism** | Moderate _Mithuna_, focus on _Nayikas_. | Explicit and abundant _Maithuna_. | Present but less emphasized than Rajarani/Khajuraho. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Deity** | None (Deconsecrated/Empty). | Shiva (Linga). | Shiva (Harihara). |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Synthesis:** The Rajarani demonstrates that the Kalinga architects were not isolated conservatives. They were cosmopolitan innovators who experimented with the high-style of Central India (Khajuraho) but ultimately decided that the pure, uncluttered verticality of the _Rekha Deul_ (as seen in the later Lingaraja) was more suited to the Odishan aesthetic. The Rajarani remains the beautiful, experimental "road not taken" for the rest of Odishan architecture.<sup>19</sup>

## 9\. Conclusion

The Rajarani Temple stands as a silent sentinel of the Somavamsi glory. It is a monument that defies easy categorization-a Shaivite temple with no Shiva, a Kalinga temple with a Nagara soul, and a "Raja-Rani" palace that is, in truth, a house of stone.

Its significance lies in its architectural daring and its sculptural perfection. For the historian, it offers a glimpse into the 11th-century synthesis of regional styles. For the devotee of art, it offers an encounter with beauty in its most pliable form-sandstone turned into silk, flesh, and fire. Whether viewed as the **Indresvara** shrine of the _Ekamra Purana_ or the **Love Temple** of the modern traveler, the Rajarani remains an indispensable chapter in the heritage of India, reminding us that in the hands of a master, even stone can be made to breathe.
