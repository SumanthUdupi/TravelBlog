# Interactive Narrative & User Agency

## Summary
Patterns for branching narratives, choices, and interactive scenes that preserve narrative coherence and user agency.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Choice moments:** short decisions that affect route or pacing (e.g., skip to a shrine vs. explore the bazaar)
- **Dynamic reveals:** progressive disclosure of context based on user choices
- **Micro-quests:** small tasks that unlock additional content (e.g., audio clip after reading about a ritual)

## Design Considerations
- Keep branching shallow to avoid combinatorial explosion
- Provide clear undo paths and preview of consequences
- Log user choices for analytics and personalized recommendations

## Action Items
1. Design 2 pilot micro-quests and test with small user group
2. Create a branching template (max depth 2–3, with checkpoints)
3. Instrument analytics to track choices and drop-off points
