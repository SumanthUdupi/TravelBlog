        <p class="drop-cap">This digital chronicle is dedicated to the timeless narratives of Odisha, a land where history whispers through the stone of ancient temples and the rustle of sacred groves.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>The Odisha Sacred Odyssey aims to preserve and present the cultural heritage of the Kalinga region through a "Digital Parchment" aesthetic. We believe that the medium of storytelling should reflect the essence of the story itself—rustic, enduring, and deeply connected to the earth.</p>

        <h2>The Constellation</h2>
        <p>Our unique "Constellation" system organizes knowledge not just as lists, but as interconnected stars in a galaxy of meaning. Use the drawer on the right to navigate through Domains, Topics, and Subtopics.</p>

        <h2>Lantern Mode</h2>
        <p>For late-night scholars and travelers, we offer "Lantern Mode". Toggle the candle icon to dim the lights and focus on the text with a warm, flickering guide.</p>
