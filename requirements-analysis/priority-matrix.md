# Priority Matrix

## Purpose
A prioritization framework to align impact vs. effort and schedule initiatives from quick wins to strategic investments.

## Matrix Bands
- **Quick Wins (High Impact / Low Effort):** WCAG fixes, image compression, meta tag updates
- **Near Term (High Impact / Medium Effort):** Content taxonomy, SEO rewrites, responsive tweaks
- **Mid Term (Medium Impact / Medium-High Effort):** Micro-interactions, faceted search
- **Strategic (High Impact / High Effort):** Immersive pilots, AR/VR, personalization

## Prioritization Example (Top 8)
1. Accessibility compliance (Phase 1)
2. Image optimization and CDN setup (Phase 1)
3. Content taxonomy + migration planning (Phase 1)
4. Meta & SEO rewrite for top pages (Phase 1)
5. Micro-interaction library (Phase 2)
6. Faceted search (Phase 2)
7. Serialized narrative campaign (Phase 2)
8. AR/VR prototyping (Phase 3)

## How to Use
