# The Parashurameshwar Temple: An Architectural and Hagiographic Monograph on the Cradle of Kalinga Temple Art

## 1\. Introduction: The Genesis of the Ekamra Kshetra

The landscape of Bhubaneswar, historically known as _Ekamra Kshetra_ (the field of the single mango tree), represents one of the most continuous and prolific zones of Hindu temple architecture in the Indian subcontinent. Among the hundreds of stone monuments that punctuate this sacred geography, the **Parashurameshwar Temple** holds a position of singular primacy. Dating to the mid-7th century CE, specifically around 650 CE, this edifice is not merely a place of worship but a structural document that records the genesis of the Odishan (Kalinga) architectural style.<sup>1</sup>

While the later Lingaraj Temple dominates the skyline with its soaring verticality and the Mukteswar Temple captivates with its delicate ornamentation, the Parashurameshwar Temple offers something far more fundamental: it is the prototype. It represents the transition from the rock-cut cave traditions of the earlier epochs to the structural masonry that would define the region's identity for the next millennium. It stands as the best-preserved specimen of the early Shailodbhava period, a time when the political unification of the region under a sovereign dynasty coincided with a religious efflorescence dominated by the Pasupata sect of Shaivism.<sup>3</sup>

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Parashurameshwar Temple. It moves beyond a superficial description to engage in a deep archaeological and historical excavation of the site. The analysis dissects the geopolitical climate of the 7th century under the Shailodbhavas, explores the complex _Sthala Purana_ (local mythology) that links the site to the sage Parashurama's penance, and offers a granular examination of its architectural anomalies-most notably the rectangular _jagamohana_ and the _triratha_ plan. Furthermore, it investigates the iconographic program, detailing the pioneering depiction of the Saptamatrikas and the distinct imagery of Lakulisa, before synthesizing these elements into a guide for the contemporary visitor.

## 2\. Historical Background: The Shailodbhava Hegemony

To understand the Parashurameshwar Temple, one must first understand the political and cultural soil from which it sprang: the reign of the **Shailodbhava Dynasty** (c. 570-750 CE).

### 2.1 The Political Landscape of the 7th Century

Following the disintegration of the Gupta Empire in the mid-6th century, the political map of eastern India was fragmented. The region of Kalinga (modern Odisha) saw the rise of the Gauda Kingdom under the powerful King Shashanka, and later, the overarching influence of Harshavardhana of Kannauj.<sup>4</sup> In this vacuum, the Shailodbhavas emerged, initially as feudatories to Shashanka, and later asserting full sovereignty over the _Kongoda-mandala_, a territory roughly corresponding to the coastal districts of Ganjam and Puri.<sup>4</sup>

The capital of the Shailodbhavas was located at Banapur, near the Chilika Lake, but their cultural patronage was heavily focused on _Ekamra Kshetra_ (Bhubaneswar). The dynasty's origin myth, recorded in copper-plate grants, traces their lineage to a tribal chieftain named Pulindasena, who prayed to Lord Swayambhu (Shiva). Shiva granted his wish by creating a man out of a rock (_shila_), who became the progenitor of the "Shailodbhava" (Born of the Rock) line.<sup>4</sup> This myth is critical as it suggests a process of "Kshatriyazation," where tribal leaders were integrated into the Brahmanical fold through Shaivite patronage.

### 2.2 Patronage of King Madhavaraja II

Historical consensus attributes the construction of the Parashurameshwar Temple to **Madhavaraja II** (also known as Sainyabhita II), a powerful ruler of the dynasty who reigned in the early-to-mid 7th century.<sup>1</sup> Madhavaraja II is described in inscriptions as a _Parama-Maheshvara_ (Devout Worshipper of Shiva). His reign marked a period of stability and surplus that allowed for monumental construction.

The construction of the Parashurameshwar Temple was likely a statement of political legitimacy. By building a grand stone temple dedicated to Shiva (the family deity), Madhavaraja II was not only accumulating religious merit (_punya_) but also signaling the permanency of his rule. The temple served as a royal chapel of sorts, bridging the gap between the king's divine right and the populace's devotion.<sup>1</sup>

### 2.3 Religious Syncretism: Shaivism and Shaktism

The Shailodbhava period was characterized by a robust form of Shaivism, specifically the **Pasupata** sect, which we will analyze in depth later. However, the dynasty also exhibited a remarkable ecumenism. While Shiva was the supreme deity, the Parashurameshwar Temple provides undeniable evidence of the rising importance of **Shaktism** (Goddess worship).

The Shailodbhavas patronized the integration of tribal goddesses into the Brahmanical pantheon. This is architecturally cemented in the Parashurameshwar Temple, which is the first temple in Bhubaneswar to feature the **Saptamatrikas** (Seven Mothers) on its walls.<sup>2</sup> This suggests that by the 7th century, the rigid boundaries between Shaiva and Shakta worship were dissolving, leading to a tantric synthesis that would characterize later Odishan religion.

### 2.4 Preservation and Renovation

Remarkably, the temple escaped the large-scale destruction that befell many North Indian temples during the Muslim invasions of the 12th and 13th centuries. Its location on the eastern coast and the specific trajectory of the invasions helped preserve it.<sup>3</sup> However, the structure did undergo significant renovation in **1903** under the British administration and the Public Works Department (PWD).<sup>1</sup> This restoration involved repairs to the inner roof of the sanctum and the clearing of the surrounding debris, but experts agree that the core structure and the sculptural schema remain faithful to the original 7th-century design.

## 3\. Sthala Purana: The Legend of Parashurama's Penance

Every major temple in India is anchored by a _Sthala Purana_-a localized myth that explains the sanctity of the site. For the Parashurameshwar Temple, this narrative revolves around **Parashurama**, the sixth avatar of Vishnu, and his quest for redemption.

### 3.1 The Burden of Matricide (**_Matri-hatya_**)

The legend begins with the sage Jamadagni, the father of Parashurama. Jamadagni's wife, Renuka, was a woman of such purity that she could carry water in unbaked clay pots. One day, while fetching water, she saw a Gandharva (celestial musician) passing by in the sky and felt a fleeting moment of admiration for his beauty. This mental lapse caused her clay pot to dissolve, and she returned home empty-handed and terrified.<sup>5</sup>

Jamadagni, perceiving her "infidelity" through his yogic powers, flew into a rage. He ordered his sons to behead their mother. The elder brothers refused, paralyzed by the horror of the command. However, Parashurama, bound by the duty of obedience to his father (_pitru-vakya paripalana_), took up his axe (_parashu_) and severed his mother's head.<sup>5</sup> Pleased by his son's obedience, Jamadagni offered him a boon. Parashurama immediately asked for his mother to be restored to life and for his brothers to be absolved of their disobedience. The sage granted this, and Renuka was revived.

### 3.2 The Penance at Ekamra Kshetra

Despite his mother's resurrection, the karmic stain of matricide (_matri-hatya_) haunted Parashurama. He felt a deep internal unease and sought a way to expiate this sin. He traveled to various _tirthas_ (pilgrimage sites) across the subcontinent.

The _Ekamra Purana_ (a text detailing the history of Bhubaneswar) states that Parashurama eventually arrived at the **Ekamra Kshetra**. Recognizing the spiritual potency of the land, which was beloved by Shiva, he chose a spot near the Bindusagar lake to perform severe penance (_tapasya_).<sup>2</sup> He meditated for years, worshipping Shiva to cleanse his soul.

### 3.3 The Divine Absolution and Consecration

Pleased by the intensity of Parashurama's devotion, Lord Shiva appeared before him. Shiva declared that Parashurama was absolved of his sin. In gratitude, Parashurama requested that Shiva reside eternally at that specific spot to bless future devotees seeking redemption.

To commemorate this event, Parashurama established a Shiva Linga at the site of his penance. This Linga came to be known as **Parashurameshvara**-a compound word meaning "The Lord (Ishvara) of Parashurama" or "The Lord Worshipped by Parashurama".<sup>1</sup> This nomenclature is significant as it follows a common Hindu naming convention where the deity is named after the devotee who installed it (similar to Rameswaram, the Lord of Rama).

### 3.4 Theological Implications

This _Sthala Purana_ serves a crucial theological function: it bridges the divide between **Vaishnavism** (represented by Parashurama, an avatar of Vishnu) and **Shaivism** (the presiding deity). By depicting a Vishnu avatar as a devotee of Shiva, the temple narrative promotes a non-sectarian worldview, suggesting that the two great deities are interconnected. This harmony is visually represented on the temple walls, where images of Vishnu and his avatars appear alongside Shiva.<sup>2</sup>

## 4\. Architectural Analysis: The Grammar of the Early Kalinga Style

The Parashurameshwar Temple is the textbook example of the formative phase of the **Kalinga School of Temple Architecture**. It illustrates the structural engineering capabilities and aesthetic preferences of the 7th century, distinct from the mature phases seen in the 11th and 13th centuries.

The temple complex consists of two primary components joined along an east-west axis:

- **The Vimana** (Sanctum Sanctorum or _Deula_).
- **The Jagamohana** (Assembly Hall or _Mukhasala_).

### 4.1 The Vimana: The Triratha Rekha Deula

The sanctum follows the _Rekha_ order, characterized by a curvilinear spire (_shikhara_) that curves inward as it rises.

#### 4.1.1 The Triratha Plan

The most defining feature of the Vimana is its **Triratha** ground plan. In Kalinga architecture, the outer walls are divided into vertical projections called _pagas_ or _rathas_.

- **Tri-ratha (Three Chariots):** The wall is divided into three segments: a central projection (**Raha Paga**) flanked by two corner projections (**Kanika Pagas**).<sup>2</sup>
- **Significance:** This is a marker of antiquity. Later temples evolved into _Pancharatha_ (five segments) and _Saptaratha_ (seven segments) to accommodate more complex iconography and create a play of light and shadow. The _Triratha_ plan of Parashurameshwar results in broad, flat surfaces that are heavily embellished with bas-relief carvings rather than high-relief sculptures in deep niches.<sup>2</sup>

#### 4.1.2 Elevation Profile

The vertical elevation of the Vimana is divided into three parts (_Tri-anga Bada_), distinct from the five-part division of later temples:

- **Bada (Wall):** The vertical wall rises abruptly from the pavement (_talapatna_) without a high plinth (_pista_), giving the temple a grounded appearance.<sup>3</sup>
- **Gandi (Trunk/Spire):** The spire curves gradually. It is heavily decorated with _Chaitya_ arches (horseshoe-shaped motifs) and _Bho_ motifs.
- Mastaka (Head): The tower is capped by a massive Amalaka (ribbed disk) and a Kalasha (finial), symbolizing the crowning glory of the cosmic mountain.3  
    The height of the Vimana is approximately 40.25 feet (12.27 meters), modest compared to the 180-foot Lingaraj, but monumental for its time.3

### 4.2 The Jagamohana: The Rectangular Anomaly

The _Jagamohana_ of the Parashurameshwar Temple is unique and represents an architectural "dead end"-an experiment that was not continued in later Odishan temples.

#### 4.2.1 Rectangular Geometry

Unlike the standard square _jagamohanas_ of the later Kalinga period, this hall is **rectangular** in plan.<sup>2</sup> This shape likely derives from earlier temporary wooden assembly halls or domestic architecture.

#### 4.2.2 The Clerestory Roof

The roof construction is a terraced slope arranged in two tiers with a **clerestory** (a vertical windowed section) between them.<sup>8</sup>

- **Function:** This design allows natural light to enter the hall, illuminating the interior sculptures.
- **Contrast:** Later temples adopted the _Pidha_ style roof-a pyramidal structure of stepped tiers without clerestory windows, resulting in dark, cavernous interiors. The Parashurameshwar's roof is more akin to the early Chalukyan temples of Aihole (e.g., the Durga Temple) than the mature Odishan style.<sup>9</sup>

#### 4.2.3 Interior Pillars

The roof of the Jagamohana is supported by **two rows of three pillars each** inside the hall.<sup>9</sup>

- **Engineering Context:** The 7th-century architects had not yet mastered the corbelling techniques required to span large square spaces without internal support. In later temples like the Mukteswar, architects eliminated internal pillars to create an unobstructed space for the congregation. The presence of pillars here is a clear chronological marker of the early phase.<sup>9</sup>

### 4.3 The Junction (Sandhi-Sthala)

The connection between the Vimana and the Jagamohana is primitive. The Jagamohana appears to have been added or joined abruptly to the Vimana, rather than being organically integrated. The sophisticated _Sandhi-sthala_ (bonding passage) seen in the Lingaraj Temple is absent here, leading some early scholars to speculate that the Jagamohana was a later addition. However, modern consensus, based on the continuity of the sculptural style, affirms they are contemporaneous.<sup>1</sup>

### 4.4 Table: Architectural Comparison

| **Architectural Feature** | **Parashurameshwar (c. 650 CE)** | **Later Kalinga Style (e.g., Lingaraj, 11th Century)** |

| --- | --- | --- |

## 5\. Iconography: The Stone Canvas

The Parashurameshwar Temple is often described as a "textile in stone" because its walls are covered in low-relief carvings that leave almost no stone unadorned. The iconography provides crucial data on the religious beliefs of the 7th century.

### 5.1 The Pasupata Sect and Lakulisa

The most dominant iconographic theme is the presence of **Lakulisa**, the founder of the Pasupata sect of Shaivism. His repeated depiction confirms that the temple was a stronghold of this specific ascetic tradition.

- **Iconography:** Lakulisa is depicted in niches, notably on the front facade of the Vimana. He holds a **Lakuta** (club) in one hand and shows the **Dharmachakra Pravartana Mudra** (turning the wheel of law) with the other.<sup>10</sup>
- **Buddhist Influence:** This specific mudra is borrowed directly from Buddhist iconography of the Buddha. This suggests a period of competitive exchange where Pasupata Shaivism was appropriating Buddhist symbols to assert its dominance.<sup>11</sup>
- **Disciples:** Lakulisa is seated on a lotus, surrounded by his four canonical disciples: **Kusika, Garga, Mitra, and Kaurushya**.<sup>11</sup>
- **Urdhvalinga:** Some images depict him as _urdhvalinga_ (ithyphallic), symbolizing the yogic retention of semen (_bindu_) and sexual energy, a core practice of the Pasupata ascetics.<sup>11</sup>

### 5.2 The Saptamatrikas (The Seven Mothers)

The Parashurameshwar Temple holds the distinction of being the first temple in Bhubaneswar to depict the Saptamatrikas group.2 Located on the northern wall of the Jagamohana, this panel is a watershed moment in Odishan art, signaling the royal acceptance of Tantric Shaktism.

The panel features the goddesses seated between Ganesha (the beginning) and Virabhadra (the terrible form of Shiva, the guardian). The iconography is specific:

- **Brahmi:** The female aspect of Brahma. Depicted with three heads (representing the Vedas) and a swan (_hamsa_) on the pedestal.
- **Maheshwari:** The power of Shiva. She holds a trident and sits on a bull.
- **Kaumari:** The power of Kartikeya (Kumara). She holds a spear (_shakti_) and is associated with the peacock.
- **Vaishnavi:** The power of Vishnu. She holds the wheel (_chakra_) and conch, riding Garuda.
- **Varahi:** The power of the Boar avatar Varaha. She is depicted with the face of a boar, holding a fish and a skull cup (_kapala_), explicitly indicating Tantric offerings.<sup>2</sup>
- **Indrani (Aindri):** The power of Indra. She holds the thunderbolt (_vajra_) and is seated on an elephant.
- **Chamunda:** The fierce destroyer of Chanda and Munda. She is depicted as emaciated, with sagging breasts and a terrifying countenance, representing the aspect of death and time.<sup>2</sup>

### 5.3 The Ashta Grahas (Eight Planets)

The lintel over the main doorway features the **Ashta Grahas** (Eight Planets).

- **Dating Evidence:** The panel depicts Surya, Chandra, Mangala, Budha, Brihaspati, Shukra, Shani, and Rahu. The ninth planet, **Ketu** (the comet's tail), is absent. Ketu was only standardized in Odishan temple art in the later centuries (post-9th century). The absence of Ketu is one of the strongest archaeological proofs for dating the temple to the 7th century.<sup>2</sup>

### 5.4 Narrative Reliefs and Other Deities

- **Ramayana and Mahabharata:** The temple walls function as a visual library of the epics. Scenes include the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, Ravana shaking Mount Kailash (**Ravananugraha-murti**), and episodes from the life of Rama.<sup>2</sup>
- **Nataraja:** Shiva as the Lord of Dance appears in the _gavaksha_ (chaitya arch) windows. These early Natarajas differ from the southern Chola bronzes; here, Shiva is often ten-armed, robust, and depicted in the _Lalita_ or _Chatura_ dance poses, radiating raw power rather than fluid grace.<sup>1</sup>
- **Kartikeya:** The son of Shiva is depicted in the southern niche, seated on a peacock. He holds a spear and a fruit, portraying the ideal warrior-youth.
- **Ganesha:** Depicted as the eater of sweets (_modaka-priya_), often without his mouse vehicle, which was a later iconographic addition.<sup>16</sup>
- **Dikpalas:** The guardians of the directions (Indra, Yama, Varuna) are carved in the niches of the Jagamohana walls, ensuring the temple is protected from all cosmic quarters.<sup>10</sup>

### 5.5 The Sahasra Linga

In the northwest corner of the courtyard lies the **Sahasra Linga** (Thousand Linga).

- **Description:** This is a massive stone Linga carved with 1,000 miniature Lingas arranged in precise vertical and horizontal rows.<sup>1</sup>
- **Symbolism:** It represents **Sadashiva**-the eternal Shiva who is infinite. It visually demonstrates the concept that Shiva is both one and many (_Ekam_ and _Bahu_). Devotees believe that a single obeisance to this Linga confers the merit of worshipping a thousand shrines.<sup>18</sup>

## 6\. Location Details and Sacred Geography

The Parashurameshwar Temple does not exist in isolation; it is a node in the complex sacred neural network of **Old Town, Bhubaneswar**.

### 6.1 Coordinates and Setting

- **Address:** Near Bindusagar Pond, Kedar Gouri Vihar, Old Town, Bhubaneswar, Odisha 751002.
- **Geolocation:** 20°14′35″N 85°50′20″E.<sup>3</sup>
- **The Ecosystem:** The temple is situated in a quiet, leafy compound maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It is part of a cluster that includes the **Mukteswar Temple** (300 meters away), the **Siddheshwar Temple**, and the **Kedar Gouri** complex.<sup>1</sup>

### 6.2 Proximity to Major Landmarks

The temple's location is ritually significant relative to other sites:

- **Lingaraj Temple (400 meters East):** The massive 11th-century temple is a short 10-minute walk away. The visual contrast between the small, ancient Parashurameshwar and the towering Lingaraj illustrates 400 years of architectural evolution.<sup>20</sup>
- **Bindusagar Lake (200 meters North):** This massive sacred tank is believed to contain water from every holy river in India. Pilgrims typically bathe here before proceeding to the temples. The Parashurameshwar Temple sits on the path leading from the tank to the Lingaraj, making it a natural stop for pilgrims.<sup>21</sup>
- **Transport Hubs:**
  - **Biju Patnaik International Airport (BBI):** Approximately 4-5 km away (15-20 min drive).
  - **Bhubaneswar Railway Station:** Approximately 4-5 km away.
  - **Baramunda ISBT (Bus Stand):** Approximately 7.3 km away.<sup>1</sup>

## 7\. Visitor Details: Practical Information

For scholars, tourists, and pilgrims, the Parashurameshwar Temple offers an accessible and profound experience.

### 7.1 Timings and Entry

- **Operational Hours:** The temple is open daily from **5:00 AM to 6:00 PM**.<sup>1</sup>
- **Best Time to Visit:** The golden hour is shortly after sunrise (6:00 AM - 7:30 AM). During this time, the rising sun illuminates the east-facing entrance and the elaborate carvings on the Jagamohana, offering the best conditions for photography and quiet contemplation.<sup>2</sup>
- **Entry Fee:** There is **NO entry fee** for this monument. Unlike the Sun Temple at Konark or the Rajarani Temple, the ASI does not charge for entry here.<sup>1</sup>
- **Religious Access:** unlike the Lingaraj Temple, which is closed to non-Hindus, the Parashurameshwar Temple is **open to people of all faiths**. This makes it the perfect site for foreign tourists to study the interior architecture of a Hindu sanctum.<sup>20</sup>

### 7.2 Festivals: The Parashuramashtami Tradition

The temple comes alive during the festival of **Parashuramashtami**, celebrated on the 8th day of the waxing moon in the month of _Ashada_ (June/July).<sup>1</sup>

- **The Ritual:** This festival celebrates the link between Lord Lingaraj and Parashurameshwar. The _Chalanti Pratima_ (mobile representative image) of Lord Lingaraj, known as **Chandrashekhara**, is brought in a grand procession from the Lingaraj Temple to the Parashurameshwar Temple.
- **Significance:** It serves as a ritual reenactment of Lord Shiva (Lingaraj) visiting his devotee (Parashurama). The deity is welcomed with flowers, music, and offerings. A special feast is organized, and thousands of devotees flock to the temple to witness this union of the two icons.<sup>2</sup>
- **Shivaratri:** During _Maha Shivaratri_ (February/March), the temple is decorated with lights. Devotees queue to pour water and milk on the Sahasra Linga and the main Shiva Linga in the sanctum.<sup>25</sup>

### 7.3 Guidelines for Visitors

- **Dress Code:** Visitors should dress modestly, covering shoulders and knees, out of respect for the sanctity of the site.<sup>20</sup>
- **Footwear:** Shoes must be removed outside the temple compound. There is usually a designated area or a caretaker to watch over them.
- **Photography:** Handheld photography is permitted. Tripods may require special permission from the ASI Bhubaneswar Circle. It is polite to ask permission before photographing priests or devotees performing rituals.<sup>20</sup>
- **Nandi:** Unusually for a Shiva temple, there is no large Nandi statue in the courtyard. However, the presence of Nandi is implied in the iconography.<sup>26</sup>

## 8\. Conclusion: The Parashurameshwar Legacy

The Parashurameshwar Temple is not merely a relic of the past; it is a living bridge. It bridges the gap between the tribal origins of the Shailodbhava dynasty and the high Brahmanical culture of the medieval period. It bridges the architectural void between rock-cut caves and the towering stone skyscrapers of the Lingaraj era. And through its _Sthala Purana_, it bridges the theological divide between the followers of Vishnu and Shiva.

For the historian, it offers a frozen moment of the 7th century-a time of experimentation, where architects were still figuring out how to build tall, and sculptors were still deciding which gods belonged on the walls. The rectangular _jagamohana_ stands as a testament to roads not taken, while the _triratha_ tower laid the geometric foundation for the golden age of Kalinga architecture.

In the bustling modern city of Bhubaneswar, amidst the noise of traffic and the rush of pilgrims to the larger temples, the Parashurameshwar Temple remains a quiet, dignified elder-small in stature but colossal in significance, holding within its stones the very DNA of Odishan culture.
