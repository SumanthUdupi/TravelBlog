## Technical Specifications

### Core Accessibility Requirements

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All interactive elements accessible via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
   - Logical tab order following visual layout and reading order
   - Focus indicators: 3px solid outline with 3:1 contrast ratio (#2563EB focus ring)
   - Skip links: "Skip to main content" and "Skip to navigation" at page top
   - Keyboard shortcuts documented and customizable

2. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - ARIA labels and descriptions for all icon-only buttons and complex widgets
   - Live regions for dynamic content updates (Context Drawer, notifications)
   - Semantic HTML structure: `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
   - Heading hierarchy (H1-H6) properly nested and descriptive
   - Form labels explicitly associated with inputs

3. **Visual Accessibility**:
   - Color contrast: Normal text 4.5:1, large text 3:1, UI controls 3:1
   - Text alternatives: Alt text for images, transcripts for audio/video
   - Zoom support: Content readable and functional at 200% zoom
   - Color blindness: Information not conveyed by color alone
   - Font customization: User-adjustable font size and family

4. **Motion and Animation**:
   ```css
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     *, *::before, *::after {
       animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
       animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
       transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
       scroll-behavior: auto !important;
     }
     .lantern-cursor { display: none !important; }
     .animated-elements { animation: none !important; }
   }
   ```

5. **Cognitive Accessibility**:
   - Clear, consistent navigation and labeling
   - Error messages descriptive and actionable
   - Time limits adjustable or removable for tasks
   - Complex features broken into simple steps

### Implementation Guidelines

**HTML Semantics**:
```html
<!-- Proper semantic structure -->
<header>
  <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main id="content">
  <article>
    <h1>Article Title</h1>
    <p>Content with proper heading hierarchy</p>
  </article>
</main>
```

**ARIA Implementation**:
```javascript
// Dynamic content updates
const liveRegion = document.getElementById('live-region');
liveRegion.setAttribute('aria-live', 'polite');
liveRegion.setAttribute('aria-atomic', 'true');

// Button with icon
<button aria-label="Save document" aria-describedby="save-tooltip">
  <svg aria-hidden="true"><!-- icon --></svg>
</button>
```

## Implementation Notes
- **Accessibility First**: Design with accessibility in mind from the start
- **Testing Integration**: Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **User Involvement**: Regular testing with users who have disabilities
