# Quick Wins (High Impact / Low Effort)

## Objective
List of immediate improvements that provide measurable benefit with small effort.

## Quick Win List
- **WCAG fixes:** color contrast, label associations, skip navigation links
- **Image optimization:** compress and serve responsive variants
- **Meta updates:** standardized title/meta templates for top pages
- **Hero loading improvements:** preconnect to assets, lazy-load below-the-fold
- **Content fixes:** add alt text, short summaries, and clear CTAs on key pages

## Implementation Steps (2–4 weeks)
1. Run automated accessibility and performance scans
2. Implement fixes on a subset of pages (pilot 10 pages)
3. Validate with manual testing and user feedback
4. Roll out site-wide and monitor KPIs

## Success Measures
- Page load time decrease (target -20%)
- WCAG AA conformance for pilot pages
- Increase in organic sessions to pilot pages

## Notes
These actions should be scheduled as the first sprint and require minimal cross-team coordination.
