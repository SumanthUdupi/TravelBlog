# Character Development: Personas as Story Anchors

## Summary
Define personas and character types to anchor stories and guide user empathy and decision-making.

## Persona Types
- **The Pilgrim** (seeking spiritual experience)
- **The Scholar** (seeking historical detail)
- **The Traveler-Family** (needs practical logistics)
- **The Visual Storyteller** (interested in photography/imagery)

## Persona Templates
- Goals, pain points, accessibility needs, emotional triggers
- Example: Pilgrim → wants peaceful experience, needs low-noise areas, prefers early morning visits

## Using Personas in Content
- Tag stories and routes by persona fit
- Tailor microcopy and CTA for persona segments
- Use personas to prioritize features in roadmap (audio guides for Pilgrim, family filters for Traveler-Family)

## Action Items
1. Create 4 to 6 canonical personas and link content to them
2. Prototype personalized landing experience based on persona
3. Validate personas through lightweight user interviews
