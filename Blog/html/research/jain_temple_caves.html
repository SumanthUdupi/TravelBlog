<h1>The Twin Hills of Kumariparvata: An Exhaustive Monograph on the
Archaeology, Epigraphy, and Architectural History of the Udayagiri and
Khandagiri Cave Complex</h1>
<section id="introduction-the-lithic-landscape-of-ancient-kalinga"
class="level2">
<h2>1. Introduction: The Lithic Landscape of Ancient Kalinga</h2>
<p>In the coastal heartland of Odisha, rising from the lateritic plains
of the Khurda district, stand two opposing sandstone eminences that
constitute one of the most significant archaeological landscapes in
Eastern India. Separated by a narrow defile through which the modern
road passes, these twin hills-Udayagiri (Hill of Sunrise) and Khandagiri
(Broken Hill)-represent a continuous chronicle of Jain monasticism,
royal patronage, and rock-cut architecture spanning over two
millennia.<sup>1</sup> Historically identified as the <em>Kumari
Parvata</em> in the celebrated Hathigumpha inscription, these hills
served as the spiritual epicenter of the ancient Kalingan empire,
particularly during the ascendancy of the Mahameghavahana dynasty in the
1st century BCE.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The site comprises a sprawling necropolis of thirty-three extant
rock-cut caves-eighteen excavated into the scarp of Udayagiri and
fifteen into Khandagiri-though historical enumerations suggest the
original complex may have housed as many as 117 distinct
excavations.<sup>4</sup> Unlike the monolithic grandeur of the trap-rock
excavations in Western India (such as Ajanta or Ellora), the Udayagiri
and Khandagiri caves are carved from coarse-grained, brittle sandstone.
This geological reality necessitated a unique architectural vocabulary;
rather than deep, cavernous prayer halls (<em>chaityas</em>), the
Kalingan artisans focused on multi-storied residential cells
(<em>lenas</em>) arranged around open courtyards, emphasizing exterior
ornamentation over interior volume.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive, expert-level analysis of the
site. It dissects the complex stratigraphy of the hills, moving from the
political zenith of Emperor Kharavela in the 1st century BCE to the
medieval renaissance under the Somavamsis, and finally to the
Maratha-period construction of the Digambara Jain temple that crowns the
summit of Khandagiri today. Through a detailed examination of epigraphic
records, architectural morphology, acoustic properties, and iconographic
evolution, this study elucidates the role of <em>Kumari Parvata</em> not
merely as a retreat for ascetics, but as a theater of state power and a
crucible of early Indian art.</p>
</section>
<section id="geo-political-context-and-historical-background"
class="level2">
<h2>2. Geo-Political Context and Historical Background</h2>
<p>To comprehend the significance of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri
complex, one must situate it within the volatile geopolitical landscape
of post-Mauryan India. The decline of the Mauryan Empire in the 2nd
century BCE created a power vacuum across the subcontinent, leading to
the rise of regional dynasties asserting their autonomy against the
waning power of Magadha. In the region of Kalinga (modern coastal
Odisha), this resurgence was spearheaded by the Mahameghavahana dynasty,
also known as the Chedi dynasty.<sup>2</sup></p>
<section id="the-rise-of-the-mahameghavahana-dynasty" class="level3">
<h3>2.1 The Rise of the Mahameghavahana Dynasty</h3>
<p>The Mahameghavahanas emerged as the custodians of Kalingan identity,
which had been brutally suppressed during the Kalinga War of Ashoka
(c. 261 BCE). The dynasty’s most illustrious ruler, Emperor Kharavela,
is the central protagonist of the Udayagiri narrative. Before the
discovery of the Hathigumpha inscription in Cave 14, Kharavela was a
phantom in Indian history, absent from the Puranic lists that typically
chronicle royal lineages. His emergence from the lithic records of
Udayagiri revolutionized the understanding of Eastern India’s political
history, presenting Kalinga not as a peripheral vassal but as an
imperial core capable of challenging the hegemony of Magadha and the
Satavahanas.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The dynasty claimed descent from the “Royal Sage Vasu” and styled
themselves as <em>Kalingadhipati</em> (Lords of Kalinga) and
<em>Maharaja</em>.<sup>3</sup> Their capital, Kalinganagari, is
frequently identified with the fortified site of Sisupalgarh located
near the twin hills, suggesting an intimate spatial relationship between
the royal citadel and the monastic retreat.<sup>8</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="the-religious-landscape-jainism-as-state-dharma"
class="level3">
<h3>2.2 The Religious Landscape: Jainism as State Dharma</h3>
<p>While the Mauryas had propagated Buddhism, the Mahameghavahanas were
staunch patrons of Jainism. The Udayagiri complex was developed
primarily as a <em>varsha-vasa</em> (monsoonal retreat) for Jain
ascetics (<em>Nirgrantha</em>). The architecture reflects the severe
austerities of the Jain path: the cells are small, devoid of creature
comforts, and feature sloping stone floors with raised pillows for
sleeping.<sup>2</sup> However, this asceticism was paradoxically
supported by immense royal wealth. Kharavela describes himself as a
“worshipper of all sects” (<em>sava-pasanda pujako</em>) but explicitly
directs his primary patronage toward the Jain <em>Sangha</em>,
recovering sacred Jain icons and constructing elaborate dwelling
places.<sup>3</sup> This synthesis of imperial aggression and religious
piety characterizes the unique ethos of the site.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-strategic-geography-of-the-twin-hills" class="level3">
<h3>2.3 The Strategic Geography of the Twin Hills</h3>
<p>The location of the caves is not accidental. The hills command a
panoramic view of the Mahanadi delta and the ancient trade routes
connecting Kalinga to the Deccan and the Ganges valley. The inscription
mentions the <em>Tanasuliya</em> road and the extension of canals,
indicating that the hills were integrated into a sophisticated hydraulic
and transport network.<sup>3</sup> The sandstone composition of the
hills, while fragile, allowed for rapid excavation, enabling the dynasty
to create a monumental legacy within a single generation-a feat that the
harder basalts of the Deccan would have delayed by decades.</p>

<section id="the-hathigumpha-inscription-the-magna-carta-of-kalinga"
class="level2">
<h2>3. The Hathigumpha Inscription: The Magna Carta of Kalinga</h2>
<p>The <em>Hathigumpha</em> (Elephant Cave) inscription, located on the
brow of Cave 14 in Udayagiri, is arguably the most critical historical
document for the 1st century BCE in Eastern India. Consisting of
seventeen lines of deep-cut Brahmi script in the Prakrit language, it
provides a year-by-year annalistic account of Kharavela’s
reign.<sup>3</sup></p>
<section id="paleography-and-decipherment-history" class="level3">
<h3>3.1 Paleography and Decipherment History</h3>
<p>The inscription was first brought to the attention of the scholarly
world by A. Stirling in 1820, but it was James Prinsep who first
attempted a decipherment in 1837. The text is notoriously difficult to
read due to natural weathering; for centuries, rainwater dripping from
the overhanging rock has eroded the central lines (lines 7-15), leading
to divergent readings by scholars such as R.L. Mitra, Bhagwanlal
Indraji, and later, the definitive edits by K.P. Jayaswal and R.D.
Banerji.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Paleographically, the script belongs to the mid-1st century BCE,
exhibiting forms slightly developed from the Ashokan Brahmi but distinct
from the later Kushana styles. This dating is corroborated by the
artistic style of the accompanying sculptures in the
caves.<sup>3</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="detailed-chronological-analysis-of-the-reign"
class="level3">
<h3>3.2 Detailed Chronological Analysis of the Reign</h3>
<p>The inscription is structured as a <em>Prashasti</em> (eulogy), but
unlike the poetic ambiguity of later Gupta inscriptions, it offers
concrete data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Coronation (Years 0-24):</strong> The text details the
Prince’s education in <em>Lekha</em> (correspondence), <em>Rupa</em>
(currency/finance), <em>Ganana</em> (accountancy), and
<em>Vyavahara</em> (law). This curriculum reveals the sophisticated
administrative training required of early Indian kings. He served as
<em>Yuvaraja</em> for nine years before being crowned at age
24.<sup>3</sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 1 (Reconstruction):</strong> Kharavela’s first
act was the restoration of his capital, Kalinganagari, which had been
devastated by a cyclone. He repaired gates, ramparts, and buildings, and
restored gardens and tanks at a cost of 3,500,000 coins. This entry
provides rare evidence of the historical frequency of cyclones in Odisha
and the state’s capacity for disaster management.<sup>3</sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 2 (The Western Expedition):</strong> In a bold
geopolitical move, Kharavela sent a vast army of cavalry, elephants,
infantry, and chariots to the west, “disregarding Satakarni” (the
powerful Satavahana king). The army reached the river
<em>Kanhabemna</em> (Krishna) and terrorized the city of the Mushikas.
This establishes the synchronicity between Kharavela and Satakarni I, a
crucial anchor for Indian chronology.<sup>3</sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 4 (The Vidyadhara Campaign):</strong> The King
subdued the Rathikas and Bhojakas, tribal chieftaincies in the
Berar/Maharashtra region. These groups were likely feudatories of the
Satavahanas, implying that Kharavela was chipping away at his rival’s
periphery.<sup>3</sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 5 (The Nanda Canal):</strong> A major hydraulic
project is recorded: the extension of a canal originally excavated by
“King Nanda” (<em>Nandaraja</em>) either 103 or 300 years prior
(<em>ti-vasa-sata</em>). This canal was brought into the capital via
Tanasuli. This line confirms that Kalinga was part of the Nanda Empire
(4th century BCE) and highlights the long-term continuity of irrigation
infrastructure in the region.<sup>3</sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 8 (The Northern Campaign and Yavana
Conflict):</strong> Kharavela stormed Gorathagiri (Barabar Hills) and
pressed towards Rajagriha. The inscription states that upon hearing
this, the <strong>Yavana King</strong> retreated to Mathura.
<ul>
<li><em>The Demetrius Controversy:</em> Early scholars like Jayaswal
read the Yavana king’s name as “Dimita” (Demetrius). However, Demetrius
I ruled c. 180 BCE, which conflicts with the late 1st-century BCE
paleography. Modern scholars (Sircar, Thapar) regard the reading as
doubtful or referring to a later Indo-Greek ruler. Nevertheless, the
mention of a Greek king confirms the extent of the Indo-Greek
penetration into the Gangetic heartland.<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 12 (The Victory over Magadha):</strong> The
climax of his military career. Kharavela watered his elephants in the
Ganges and compelled <strong>Bahasatimita</strong> (identified by some
as Pushyamitra Sunga or a localized Magadhan ruler) to bow at his feet.
<ul>
<li><em>Recovery of the Kalinga Jina:</em> Most significantly, he
brought back the “Kalinga Jina,” a sacred Jain image that had been
looted by the Nanda King centuries earlier. This act of “heritage
repatriation” served as a powerful symbol of Kalinga’s restored
sovereignty and national pride.<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 13 (The Religious Turn):</strong> The narrative
shifts from conquest to piety. On the <em>Kumari Parvata</em>
(Udayagiri), Kharavela excavated caves for Jain monks, erected pillars,
and held a council of ascetics, distributing white garments. This marks
the transition of the site from a natural retreat to a royal
monastery.<sup>6</sup></li>

<h2>4. Architectural Survey of Udayagiri (Sunrise Hill)</h2>
<p>The Udayagiri hill, housing 18 caves, represents the royal precinct
of the complex. The caves here are more ornate, larger, and historically
significant than those on Khandagiri.<sup>4</sup></p>
<section id="cave-1-rani-gumpha-the-queens-cave" class="level3">
<h3>4.1 Cave 1: Rani Gumpha (The Queen’s Cave)</h3>
<p>The <em>Rani Gumpha</em> is the architectural masterpiece of the
site. It is a double-storeyed monastery located on the eastern slope,
designed in a U-shape with a spacious open courtyard.<sup>2</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structural Morphology:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Storey:</strong> The main wing features seven
entrances opening into cells, flanked by side wings. The verandas are
supported by pillars (now mostly reconstructed).</li>
<li><strong>Upper Storey:</strong> Accessible by a flight of steps, the
upper veranda is supported by nine columns. The cells here are more
spacious, suggesting they were reserved for high-ranking monks or
perhaps the royal family during retreats.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Acoustic Theatre Hypothesis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Scholars such as C. Thomas Ault have proposed that Rani Gumpha
functioned as an ancient acoustical theatre. Computerized modeling using
CATT-Acoustic software indicates that the courtyard (serving as an
<em>orchestra</em>) and the pillared cells (acting as resonators)
possess acoustic properties similar to Hellenistic theaters described by
Vitruvius.<sup>17</sup> The “canting” of the upper storey walls and the
specific dimensions create a reverberation field ideal for speech and
music. This aligns with the Hathigumpha inscription’s mention of
Kharavela entertaining his subjects with <em>Gandharva</em> (music and
dance).<sup>16</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Iconography and Friezes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The friezes of Rani Gumpha are secular and narrative, depicting
royal processions, hunting scenes, and combat.</li>
<li><strong>The Yavana Guard:</strong> A high-relief sculpture on the
upper right wing depicts a <em>dvarapala</em> (door guardian) wearing a
short kilt, boots, and a headband-attire distinctly non-Indian and
identified as Greek (<em>Yavana</em>). This visual evidence corroborates
the text’s mention of contact with the Yavana kingdom.<sup>4</sup></li>
<li><strong>The Duel Scene:</strong> One frieze depicts a duel between a
man and a woman, which some art historians interpret as a scene from a
lost play or a historic event, emphasizing the martial culture of the
period.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cave-10-ganesha-gumpha" class="level3">
<h3>4.2 Cave 10: Ganesha Gumpha</h3>
<p>Located higher up the hill, Ganesha Gumpha is pivotal for
understanding the site’s evolution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guardians:</strong> The entrance is flanked by two massive,
monolithic elephants holding lotus flowers and mango branches. This is
the earliest known instance in Indian architecture of elephants
functioning as guardians, a motif that would later become ubiquitous in
temple architecture.<sup>20</sup></li>
<li><strong>The Udayana-Vasavadatta Frieze:</strong> The veranda
features a detailed narrative relief depicting the romantic legend of
King Udayana of Kausambi and Princess Vasavadatta of Ujjayini. Scenes
include the elopement on an elephant, the battle with pursuers, and the
subsequent dejection of the soldiers. The presence of such romantic
literature in a monastic cave suggests a liberal intellectual atmosphere
where monks were conversant with secular courtly
epics.<sup>20</sup></li>
<li><strong>The Ganesha Image:</strong> The cave derives its name from a
relief of Ganesha carved on the rear wall of the right cell. Crucially,
this image is a <strong>medieval addition</strong> (Somavamsi period),
superimposed on the ancient structure. It illustrates the site’s
transition from exclusive Jainism to a syncretic environment where Hindu
deities were integrated.<sup>20</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cave-9-manchapuri-and-swargapuri" class="level3">
<h3>4.3 Cave 9: Manchapuri and Swargapuri</h3>
<p>This double-storeyed complex is vital for dynastic history.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inscriptions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The upper storey (<em>Swargapuri</em>) bears an inscription of
Kharavela’s <strong>Chief Queen</strong> (<em>Aga-Mahisi</em>),
identifying her as the daughter of the King of Hastimipura (possibly
Hathigumpha or a separate kingdom). This highlights the high status of
women and their independent capacity to patronize
architecture.<sup>21</sup></li>
<li>The lower storey (<em>Manchapuri</em>) contains inscriptions of King
<strong>Kudepasiri</strong> (Kharavela’s successor) and Prince
<strong>Vadukha</strong>. These records prove that the dynasty continued
to support the site after Kharavela, although the grandeur of
construction diminished.<sup>22</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reliefs:</strong> The central relief depicts a royal group
(King, Queen, and Prince) worshipping a religious symbol (possibly the
Kalinga Jina or a Tree). This is a rare portrait of the royal family in
a devotional context.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cave-12-vyaghra-gumpha-the-tiger-cave" class="level3">
<h3>4.4 Cave 12: Vyaghra Gumpha (The Tiger Cave)</h3>
<p>This small cave represents a unique zoomorphic experiment in rock-cut
architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> The entrance is carved to resemble the
gaping mouth of a tiger, with the upper jaw forming the roof and the
throat leading into the cell. This terrifying facade was likely
symbolic, representing the ascetic’s triumph over fear and the wild
nature of the forest.<sup>24</sup></li>
<li><strong>Inscription:</strong> An inscription identifies it as the
donation of the “Town Judge” (<em>Nagara-Akhadamsa</em>) named
<strong>Sabhuti</strong>. This indicates that patronage extended beyond
the royal family to the bureaucratic elite of
Kalinganagari.<sup>4</sup></li>

<h3>4.5 Cave 14: Hathi Gumpha (The Elephant Cave)</h3>
<p>While architecturally simple-a large natural cavern with little
modification-its historical weight is immense.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Inscription:</strong> The brow of the cave bears the
17-line Hathigumpha inscription. The preservation of the text here,
despite the natural cave setting, suggests it was chosen for its
visibility and permanence.<sup>15</sup></li>
<li><strong>Structural Failure:</strong> The veranda pillars have
collapsed, likely due to the poor quality of the sandstone and the
widening of the natural fissure, a reminder of the geological challenges
faced by the artisans.<sup>4</sup></li>

<li><strong>Cave 5 (Jaya Vijaya Gumpha):</strong> A double-storeyed cave
named after the two donors mentioned in its inscription. It features a
Bodhi tree worship scene, illustrating the shared artistic vocabulary

was excavated by the attendant <em>Kusuma</em>. The use of bird motifs
is decorative but also possibly symbolic of the transmission of
teachings.<sup>4</sup></li>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> These caves feature simple
single-cell layouts with pillared verandas, characteristic of the early
phase.</li>

<h3>5.3 The Medieval Group: Navamuni, Barabhuji, and Trisula</h3>
<p>A significant cluster of caves on Khandagiri (Caves 7, 8, 9) was
modified or excavated during the Somavamsi period (11th century CE),
marking a theological shift in Odishan Jainism.<sup>2</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iconographic Revolution:</strong> Unlike the aniconic
Kharavela period (where the Jina was represented by symbols), these
caves are filled with high-relief sculptures of the Tirthankaras in
human form.</li>
<li><strong>Barabhuji Gumpha (Cave 8):</strong> Named after the
twelve-armed (<em>Barabhuji</em>) Sasana Devi Chakresvari. The walls are
carved with the figures of all 24 Tirthankaras, each accompanied by
their specific <em>Sasana Devi</em> (attendant goddess). This highlights
the influence of <strong>Tantric Jainism</strong>, where the worship of
female deities (<em>Yakshinis</em>) gained prominence alongside the
Tirthankaras.<sup>4</sup></li>
<li><strong>Trisula Gumpha:</strong> Features a unique arrangement of
three Tirthankaras, giving the cave its name (Trident/Three-pronged).
The roughness of the sculpture compared to the delicate work of Ananta
Gumpha indicates the decline in stone-carving finesse by the medieval
period.<sup>29</sup></li>

<h2>6. The Digambara Jain Temple: The Crown of Khandagiri</h2>
<p>Ascending the steps past the medieval caves, one reaches the flat
summit of Khandagiri, which is crowned by a living place of worship-the
Digambara Jain Temple.<sup>31</sup></p>
<section id="historical-stratigraphy-and-maratha-patronage"
class="level3">
<h3>6.1 Historical Stratigraphy and Maratha Patronage</h3>
<p>While guides and local legends often attribute the temple’s
foundation to Kharavela, architectural analysis confirms it is a much
later structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maratha Period Construction:</strong> The current edifice
was constructed in the first quarter of the <strong>19th
century</strong> (c. 1800-1825 CE) under the patronage of the Maratha
rulers of Cuttack, who controlled Odisha before the British conquest in
1803.<sup>31</sup></li>
<li><strong>Reuse of Antiquity:</strong> Despite its “modern” date, the
temple stands on a site of ancient sanctity. It is built using stone
salvaged from earlier, collapsed temples or caves on the hill. This
continuity of site-where a 19th-century temple sits atop 1st-century BCE
foundations-exemplifies the concept of a <em>Tirtha</em> (crossing
place), which remains sacred across dynasties.<sup>31</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="architectural-style" class="level3">
<h3>6.2 Architectural Style</h3>
<p>The temple is a quintessential example of the <strong>Kalingan
Pidha</strong> order, adapted for Jain worship.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan and Elevation:</strong> It follows a <em>triratha</em>
(three-projection) plan. The elevation consists of a <em>Vimana</em>
(sanctum) with a curvilinear spire and a <em>Jagamohana</em>
(rectangular porch) with a pyramidal roof. The walls are constructed of
dressed sandstone ashlar.<sup>31</sup></li>
<li><strong>Exterior:</strong> The exterior walls are relatively plain
compared to Hindu temples of Bhubaneswar, reflecting Jain austerity, but
feature <em>Khakhara-mundi</em> and <em>Pidha-mundi</em>
niches.<sup>31</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="iconography-and-deities" class="level3">
<h3>6.3 Iconography and Deities</h3>
<p>The temple complex comprises three main shrines, housing icons that
bridge the ancient and modern eras:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Deity:</strong> The central shrine houses a colossal
black stone image of <strong>Parshvanatha</strong> (the 23rd
Tirthankara), standing in <em>Kayotsarga</em> (body-abandonment) pose
beneath a seven-hooded serpent canopy. This image is likely of medieval
origin (Somavamsi period) and was re-consecrated in the new
temple.<sup>32</sup></li>
<li><strong>Mahavira:</strong> A secondary shrine contains a white
marble idol of <strong>Mahavira</strong> (the 24th Tirthankara),
reflecting the material preferences of North Indian Jain communities
(Marwari/Gujarati) who contributed to the temple’s later
maintenance.<sup>33</sup></li>
<li><strong>The Five Tirthankaras:</strong> A third shrine contains a
panel of five Tirthankaras, emphasizing the <em>Panch-Kalyanaka</em>
concept.<sup>33</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-living-tradition" class="level3">
<h3>6.4 The Living Tradition</h3>
<p>Unlike the caves below, which are archaeological monuments managed by
the ASI, the temple is an active place of worship managed by the
<em>Bengal, Bihar and Odisha Digambar Jain Tirthkshetra
Committee</em>.<sup>31</sup> It remains a focal point for the Jain
community, particularly during Mahavir Jayanti, where the continuity of
worship links the modern devotee to the ascetic traditions of
Kharavela’s time.</p>

<h2>7. Art Historical Analysis: The Kalinga School</h2>
<p>The art of Udayagiri and Khandagiri constitutes a distinct “School of
Kalinga Art,” which operates in dialogue with the contemporary schools
of Bharhut (Sunga) and Sanchi (Satavahana).<sup>34</sup></p>
<section id="stylistic-characteristics" class="level3">
<h3>7.1 Stylistic Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical Perspective:</strong> The artisans employed a
“vertical perspective” where objects in the distance are placed above,
rather than behind, foreground objects. This creates a flattened,
tapestry-like effect.<sup>35</sup></li>
<li><strong>Robust Physiognomy:</strong> The human figures are depicted
with heavy, earthy bodies-broad chests, thick limbs, and large heads.
This stylistic trait links them to the <em>Yaksha</em> and
<em>Yakshi</em> figures of the Mauryan era, suggesting a folk-art origin
for the stone carving tradition.<sup>36</sup></li>
<li><strong>Narrative Dynamism:</strong> Unlike the static poses of the
medieval period, the Kharavela-era reliefs are full of movement. In Rani
Gumpha, women fight lions, kings hunt deer, and dancers perform with
vigor. This reflects a “world-affirming” artistic spirit that seemingly
contradicts the “world-denying” asceticism of the
caves.<sup>27</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="comparison-with-bharhut-and-sanchi" class="level3">
<h3>7.2 Comparison with Bharhut and Sanchi</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secular Subject Matter:</strong> While Bharhut and Sanchi
focus almost exclusively on <em>Jataka</em> tales and the life of
Buddha, the Udayagiri reliefs are strikingly secular. There are no
obvious “Jain Puranic” stories (like the lives of Tirthankaras) in the
early caves. Instead, we see the King’s biography, courtly romances
(Udayana-Vasavadatta), and scenes of daily life. This suggests that the
art was intended to glorify the Royal Patron as much as the
religion.<sup>35</sup></li>
<li><strong>Aniconism:</strong> Like early Buddhism, early Kalingan
Jainism was aniconic. The Tirthankara is never depicted in human form in
the 1st-century caves. Instead, the <em>Swastika</em>,
<em>Nandipada</em> (taurine symbol), <em>Triratna</em>, and
<em>Chaitya-Vriksha</em> (Sacred Tree) serve as proxies for the divine.
The shift to anthropomorphic icons occurs only in the medieval
Khandagiri caves, paralleling the shift in Buddhism from Hinayana to
Mahayana iconography.<sup>37</sup></li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Second and Third-Order Insights</h2>
<section id="the-jain-state-paradox" class="level3">
<h3>8.1 The “Jain State” Paradox</h3>
<p>The analysis of the site reveals a profound third-order insight:
Under Kharavela, Jainism functioned as a “State Religion” in a manner
usually associated with Ashokan Buddhism or Gupta Hinduism. The
Hathigumpha inscription uses religious rhetoric (<em>Dharma-raja</em>)
to justify military aggression (<em>Digvijaya</em>). The “Kalinga Jina”
was not just a religious idol but a <strong>Palladium of the
State</strong>-its possession conferred legitimacy. This challenges the
simplistic view of Jainism as a politically passive faith; here, it was
the ideological engine of an empire.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-theater-of-power" class="level3">
<h3>8.2 The Theater of Power</h3>
<p>The acoustic evidence from Rani Gumpha suggests that the distinction
between “monastery” and “palace” was blurred. If the King held musical
performances (<em>Gandharva</em>) within the monastic complex, it
implies that the Jain monks were not isolated recluses but integral
components of the royal court’s cultural life. The caves were a stage
where the King demonstrated his piety to the public, turning asceticism
into a spectacle of state benevolence.</p>
</section>
<section id="heritage-repatriation-and-national-identity"
class="level3">
<h3>8.3 Heritage Repatriation and National Identity</h3>
<p>Kharavela’s recovery of the Jina image from Magadha is one of the
earliest recorded instances of <strong>heritage repatriation</strong> in
global history. It demonstrates that ancient Indian states possessed a
deep sense of historical memory (remembering a theft from 300 years
prior) and linked their political legitimacy to specific cultural
artifacts. The “Kalinga Jina” was the soul of the nation, and its return
was the ultimate validation of Kharavela’s rule.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The twin hills of Udayagiri and Khandagiri are more than a collection
of rock-cut shelters; they are a lithic archive of a civilization that
rose from the ashes of the Mauryan conquest to assert its own imperial
identity. From the “tiger’s mouth” of Cave 12 to the acoustic courtyard
of Rani Gumpha, and from the defiant lines of the Hathigumpha
inscription to the quiet sanctity of the summit temple, the site
encapsulates the resilience of the Kalingan spirit.</p>
<p>It tells the story of a King who conquered India to restore his
nation’s pride, of a Queen who patronized the arts, and of a community
of monks who dwelt in the heart of the stone. Today, as the bells of the
Digambara temple ring out over the silent, empty cells of the ancient
ascetics, the hills remain a living testament to the endurance of faith
and the permanence of stone.</p>

<h3>10. Visitor Information and Conservation Status (2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Designation:</strong> Monument of National Importance (ASI);
“Adarsh Smarak”.<sup>2</sup></li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee:</strong> INR 25 (Indian Nationals), INR 250-300
(Foreign Nationals).<sup>38</sup></li>
<li><strong>Timings:</strong> Sunrise to Sunset (Daily). The Jain Temple
is open from early morning for worship.<sup>38</sup></li>
<li><strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> November to February (Winter),
to avoid the intense heat that radiates from the
sandstone.<sup>38</sup></li>
<li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The porous sandstone faces severe
threats from water seepage and wind erosion. The ASI conducts regular
chemical preservation, but the “broken” nature of Khandagiri requires
constant structural stabilization.<sup>28</sup></li>
