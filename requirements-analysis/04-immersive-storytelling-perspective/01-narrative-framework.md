# Narrative Framework

## Summary
A repeatable structure for long-form and interactive narratives that supports emotional arcs and user agency.

## Core Principles
- **Clear Arc:** Setup → Discovery → Challenge → Resolution
- **Emotional Anchors:** Use personal voices, sensory detail, and cultural context
- **Modular Scenes:** Break narratives into reusable scenes that can be recombined

## Template
- Opening hook (scene + sensory detail)
- Context & history (short, referenced)
- Personal angle / local voice
- Practical payoff (how to visit, tips)
- Reflection & next steps (links to related content)

## Examples
- Pilgrimage route: map-based scenes with audio clips at each stop
- Place profile: start with a unique sensory detail (smell, sound), then history

## Action Items
1. Create a narrative template library for writers
2. Tag content by emotional tone and use in recommendation systems
3. Pilot 3 immersive narratives with mixed media (audio+text+gallery)
