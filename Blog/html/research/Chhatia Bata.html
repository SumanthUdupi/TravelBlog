<h1>The Sentinel of the Satya Yuga: An Exhaustive Ethnographic and
Theological Report on Chhatia Bata and the Malika Prophecies</h1>
<section id="executive-summary" class="level2">
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This comprehensive research report provides an in-depth analysis of
Chhatia Bata, a temple complex in the Jajpur district of Odisha, India,
which occupies a singular position in Hindu eschatology. Unlike
conventional shrines dedicated to the preservation of past divine
narratives, Chhatia Bata is a “futuristic temple” <sup>1</sup>,
architecturally and ritually constructed to serve as the epicenter for
the arrival of Kalki, the tenth and final avatar of Lord Vishnu. Drawing
upon extensive field notes, historical archives, and the cryptic
literature of the <em>Bhavishya Malika</em>, this document explores the
temple’s intricate connection to the Jagannath Temple in Puri, the
socio-religious legacy of the 18th-century saint Mahapurusha Hadi Das,
and the apocalyptic prophecies that predict the relocation of the “Lord
of the Universe” to this sanctuary during the final cataclysm
(<em>Pralaya</em>) of the Kali Yuga.</p>
<p>The analysis posits that Chhatia Bata functions not merely as a place
of worship but as a “fortress of expectation.” Every aspect of its
existence-from the fortified walls to the perpetual construction work,
from the “growing swords” of the deities to the optical illusions of the
sanctum-is designed to prepare for a cosmic transition. The report
further examines the geopolitical and environmental specificity of the
<em>Malika</em> prophecies, which forecast rising sea levels, global
conflict involving specific nations, and the ultimate restoration of
<em>Dharma</em> (righteousness) starting from this precise geographical
coordinate. By synthesizing the oral traditions of the
<em>Panchasakha</em> lineage with contemporary observations of the
temple’s administration and ritual life, this report offers a nuanced
understanding of how a local shrine embodies a universal apocalyptic
vision.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction: The Eschatological Landscape of Odisha</h2>
<section id="the-concept-of-the-second-srikshetra" class="level3">
<h3>1.1 The Concept of the “Second Srikshetra”</h3>
<p>In the sacred geography of India, Odisha is dominated by the presence
of <em>Srikshetra</em> (Puri), the eternal abode of Lord Jagannath. It
is the spiritual axis where the Lord resides as the <em>Darubrahma</em>
(Wooden Absolute). However, lurking within the Odia Vaishnava
consciousness is the persistent belief in a “Second Srikshetra”-a
sanctuary designated for the future. Chhatia Bata, situated in the
Jajpur district, claims this title not as a metaphor, but as a literal,
prophetic destiny.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The designation “Second Srikshetra” implies a transfer of sanctity.
It suggests that the holiness of Puri is not static but mobile, capable
of relocating in response to cosmic necessity. The <em>Malika</em>
literature, a collection of prophetic texts revered in rural Odisha,
explicitly states that when the Kali Yuga reaches its zenith and the
waters of the Bay of Bengal rise to engulf the 22 steps (<em>Baishi
Pahachha</em>) of the Puri temple, the deities-Jagannath, Balabhadra,
and Subhadra-will abandon their ancient home and migrate to
Chhatia.<sup>5</sup> This belief transforms the landscape of Chhatia
into a dormant holy land, a “temple-in-waiting” that derives its
significance not from what it is, but from what it will become.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-intersection-of-myth-and-geography" class="level3">
<h3>1.2 The Intersection of Myth and Geography</h3>
<p>Chhatia Bata is located approximately 30 kilometers from Cuttack and
48-50 kilometers from Jajpur town, placing it along a vital historical
corridor of Odisha.<sup>3</sup> The site is geographically defined by
the presence of an ancient Banyan tree (<em>Bata</em>), which gives the
temple its name.<sup>9</sup> In Hindu cosmology, the Banyan tree
(<em>Ficus benghalensis</em>) is the <em>Akshaya Vata</em>-the undying
tree that survives the dissolution of the universe. Its presence at
Chhatia serves as a botanical anchor for the eschatological claims of
the site, symbolizing continuity amidst the prophesied destruction.</p>
<p>The surrounding region of Jajpur is historically significant as the
ancient capital of the Somavamsi and Bhauma-Kara dynasties and a major
center of Shakti worship (Biraja Khetra). The emergence of a Vaishnava
apocalyptic center in this Shakti-dominated landscape represents a
unique synthesis of Odia spiritual traditions, where the fierce energy
of the Goddess (who presides over time and destruction) merges with the
preserving and restoring function of Vishnu as Kalki.</p>

<h2>2. Historical and Lineage Foundations</h2>
<section id="the-legacy-of-the-eastern-gangas" class="level3">
<h3>2.1 The Legacy of the Eastern Gangas</h3>
<p>While the current theological narrative of Chhatia Bata focuses on
the future, its physical origins are deeply rooted in Odisha’s medieval
history. Historical records indicate that the temple’s initial
foundations date back to the 12th century, during the reign of
Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva.<sup>3</sup> This is the same monarch
credited with initiating the construction of the colossal Jagannath
Temple in Puri.</p>
<p>The synchronization of the origins of both temples is crucial. It
suggests that Chhatia was not an afterthought but part of a broader
network of imperial patronage that sought to map the divine geography of
the state. Over the centuries, however, the specific significance of
Chhatia evolved from a standard shrine to a center of mystic prophecy,
particularly under the influence of the <em>Panchasakha</em> movement in
the 16th century and later through Hadi Das in the 18th century.</p>
</section>
<section id="mahapurusha-hadi-das-the-architect-of-prophecy"
class="level3">
<h3>2.2 Mahapurusha Hadi Das: The Architect of Prophecy</h3>
<p>The spiritual identity of Chhatia Bata is synonymous with the life
and works of <strong>Mahapurusha Hadi Das</strong> (1772-1837
CE).<sup>11</sup> Born in the village of Champapur, a mere kilometer
from the temple, to a family of the <em>Kamar</em> (blacksmith) caste,
Hadi Das exemplifies the egalitarian ethos of the Bhakti movement in
Odisha. His parents, Chemei Ojha and Devaki, were of humble standing,
yet Hadi Das rose to become a saint-poet of immense
stature.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Hadi Das is widely regarded within the tradition as the reincarnation
of <strong>Saint Achyutananda Das</strong>, the most prominent of the
five <em>Panchasakha</em> saints.<sup>1</sup> The <em>Panchasakha</em>
(Five Friends)-Achyutananda, Balarama, Jagannatha, Yashowanta, and
Ananta-were 16th-century mystics who democratized spirituality,
translating Sanskrit scriptures into Odia and emphasizing the power of
the <em>Nama</em> (divine name) over elaborate Vedic rituals. They were
also the originators of the <em>Malika</em> tradition.</p>
<p>Hadi Das’s claim to being Achyutananda’s successor is not merely a
matter of prestige; it provides the theological authority for his
prophecies. If Achyutananda foresaw the end of the age, Hadi Das was the
vessel chosen to articulate the specifics of the transition. His
<em>Sadhana Pitha</em> (seat of meditation) was under the great Banyan
tree at Chhatia, where he is believed to have engaged in severe
austerities and communicated with the divine.<sup>1</sup> It was here
that he composed his seminal works, including the <em>Hadidas
Malika</em>, <em>Shankhanavi</em>, <em>Ananta Gupta Gita</em>, and
<em>Nila Madhava Gita</em>.<sup>11</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="the-guru-parampara-lineage" class="level3">
<h3>2.3 The Guru Parampara (Lineage)</h3>
<p>The continuity of the spiritual tradition at Chhatia Bata is
maintained through a specific lineage of <em>Mathadhis</em> (abbots) who
trace their authority back to Hadi Das. According to temple records and
oral history, the succession is as follows <sup>8</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mahapurusha Hadi Das</strong>: The founder and
visionary.</li>
<li><strong>Chaitanya Das</strong>: The immediate successor who
consolidated the order.</li>
<li><strong>Gobinda Das</strong>: Continued the preservation of the
Malika manuscripts.</li>
<li><strong>Balram Das</strong>: Furthered the reach of the temple’s
teachings.</li>
<li><strong>Paramhans Shri Anandadas Maharaj</strong>: The current
presiding <em>Mathadhis</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This lineage ensures that the interpretation of the prophecies and
the performance of the specific rituals required to “keep the portal
open” for Lord Kalki remain uncorrupted. The current Mathadhis,
Anandadas Maharaj, is actively involved in overseeing the temple’s
expansion, interpreting modern events through the lens of ancient texts,
and guiding the growing community of believers.<sup>8</sup></p>

<section id="the-malika-scripture-of-the-end-times" class="level2">
<h2>3. The Malika: Scripture of the End Times</h2>
<section id="the-nature-of-the-text" class="level3">
<h3>3.1 The Nature of the Text</h3>
<p>The <em>Malika</em> is a unique genre of Odia literature that
combines cosmology, astrology, social critique, and prophecy. Unlike the
static hymns of the Vedas, the <em>Malika</em> is dynamic; it is viewed
by its followers as a “living document” that decodes the unfolding chaos
of the Kali Yuga.<sup>5</sup> The texts are often cryptic, employing
metaphorical language, numerical codes, and inverse logic (e.g.,
<em>Kali Ma</em> written in reverse) to veil their true meaning from the
uninitiated.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The primary contention of the <em>Bhavishya Malika</em> (attributed
to Achyutananda and elaborated by Hadi Das) is that the duration of the
Kali Yuga is not the traditional 432,000 years cited in mainstream
Puranas. Instead, due to the rapid accumulation of human sin, the age
has been condensed to a mere 5,000 years.<sup>13</sup> This radical
shortening of the timeline places the “End Times” not in the distant
future, but in the immediate present, lending an urgent, apocalyptic
charge to the devotion at Chhatia.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-prophecies-and-modern-correlates" class="level3">
<h3>3.2 Key Prophecies and Modern Correlates</h3>
<p>The credibility of the <em>Malika</em> among the masses stems from
its perceived accuracy in predicting historical and contemporary events.
Devotees and scholars of the text point to a series of fulfilled
prophecies that validate the broader eschatological narrative:</p>
<section id="the-environmental-collapse-and-puris-submersion"
class="level4">
<h4>3.2.1 The Environmental Collapse and Puri’s Submersion</h4>
<p>The most famous prophecy concerns the environmental fate of Puri. The
verse <em>“Jiba Jagata Hoieba Lina - Baishi Pahache Kheliba Mina”</em>
(All life will merge/vanish; fish will play on the 22 steps) is the
foundational text of Chhatia’s theology.<sup>1</sup> It predicts a
catastrophic rise in sea levels that will inundate the Jagannath
Temple.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sign of the Cyclone:</strong> Achyutananda Das wrote that a
storm would break a branch of the <em>Kalpavata</em> (sacred banyan) in
Puri and bend the <em>Neel Chakra</em> (blue wheel) atop the main spire.
This was widely reported to have occurred during <strong>Cyclone Fani in
May 2019</strong>, an event that electrified the believer community and
reinforced the belief that the “End” is imminent.<sup>13</sup></li>
<li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> Modern interpretations link these
ancient verses to climate change, glacial melting, and rising ocean
levels, positioning the <em>Malika</em> as a proto-ecological
manifesto.<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-geopolitical-cataclysm" class="level4">
<h4>3.2.2 The Geopolitical Cataclysm</h4>
<p>The <em>Malika</em> does not limit itself to natural disasters; it
envisions a global conflict. A specific prophecy warns of an invasion of
India by a coalition of “China and thirteen Islamic
countries”.<sup>14</sup> This war is described as a clash of
civilizations fueled by religious conflict, leading to widespread
devastation. However, the text promises that India will eventually
counterattack and, with divine intervention, absorb these territories
into a united spiritual empire.<sup>14</sup> This narrative provides a
nationalist-theological framework for understanding modern geopolitical
tensions, casting India’s defense as a cosmic duty supported by the
avatar.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-departure-of-yogamaya" class="level4">
<h4>3.2.3 The Departure of Yogamaya</h4>
<p>Another specific signpost mentioned is the departure of <strong>Mata
Yogamaya</strong> (worshipped as Maa Biraja in Jajpur) from her temple.
The <em>Malika</em> states that when the Goddess leaves her abode, the
gods will proclaim the descent of Kalki. Devotees claim this spiritual
event occurred in <strong>2004</strong>, marking the beginning of the
transition period.<sup>13</sup></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-translation-movement" class="level3">
<h3>3.3 The Translation Movement</h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to translate the
<em>Bhavishya Malika</em> from palm-leaf manuscripts into Hindi,
English, and other languages. Pandit Shri Kashinath Mishra and others
have been instrumental in this, aiming to warn a global audience of the
upcoming “Satya Yuga” (Age of Truth) which is predicted to commence by
<strong>2032</strong>.<sup>12</sup> This missionary zeal transforms the
local cult of Chhatia into a global apocalyptic movement, inviting
people everywhere to prepare for the inevitable.</p>

<h2>4. The Fortress of Faith: Temple Architecture and Iconography</h2>
<section id="the-citadel-of-chhatia" class="level3">
<h3>4.1 The Citadel of Chhatia</h3>
<p>Chhatia Bata differs visually from the typical open-plan temples of
rural Odisha. It is enclosed by high, imposing walls that give it the
appearance of a military fortification or a citadel.<sup>1</sup> This
“fortress aesthetic” is intentional. If Chhatia is to be the staging
ground for the final battle against evil, it must look the part. The
outer walls serve as a boundary between the profane, decaying world of
the Kali Yuga and the sacred, protected space of the future Satya
Yuga.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-iconography-of-the-warrior-trinity" class="level3">
<h3>4.2 The Iconography of the Warrior Trinity</h3>
<p>The most striking feature of Chhatia Bata is the transformation of
the deities. In Puri, Jagannath is the <em>Darubrahma</em>, a formless,
armless, benevolent entity with large, round eyes symbolizing universal
vision. At Chhatia, the iconography is martial and kinetic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Horses:</strong> The entrance gate and the main sanctum
depict the deities on horseback. <strong>Lord Jagannath rides a black
horse</strong>, while <strong>Lord Balabhadra rides a white
horse</strong>.<sup>1</sup> This imagery is drawn directly from the
<em>Kalki Purana</em>, where the avatar is described as riding the white
steed <em>Devadatta</em>. The presence of the black horse for Jagannath
adds a unique local variation, possibly symbolizing the dual nature of
time (night/day, destruction/creation).</li>
<li><strong>The Swords:</strong> Both deities are depicted wielding
swords, a sharp departure from the conch, discus, mace, and lotus of
traditional Vishnu iconography.</li>
<li><strong>The Growing Sword Legend:</strong> A potent local legend
asserts that the sword held by the deities is alive. Devotees and
priests claim that the sword <em>Nandaka</em> is physically growing in
length over time. The belief is that when the sword reaches a specific
length or is fully unsheathed, it will signal the moment for the Kalki
Avatar to manifest and begin the slaughter of the wicked.<sup>1</sup>
This legend imbues the physical object with a sense of organic,
terrifying anticipation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-hall-of-illusion-the-mirror-of-balabhadra"
class="level3">
<h3>4.3 The Hall of Illusion: The Mirror of Balabhadra</h3>
<p>The interior layout of the sanctum presents a deliberate
architectural puzzle. The main idols (<em>Murtis</em>) of Jagannath,
Balabhadra, and Subhadra are giant, imposing figures. However, they do
not face the entrance door directly. Instead, they are oriented sideways
or positioned in such a way that they are obscured from the direct line
of sight of a devotee standing at the threshold.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>To remedy this, a mirror has been strategically placed on the
opposite wall or in front of Lord Balabhadra. Visitors can only see the
full face of the deity by looking into this mirror. This feature creates
an “optical illusion” or a “mysterious reflection”.1</p>
<p>Theological Interpretation: This arrangement is rich in symbolism. It
suggests that in the Kali Yuga, the truth (God) cannot be seen directly;
it can only be perceived through reflection (indirect knowledge or
Maya). It also emphasizes the elusive nature of the avatar-He is
present, but not yet fully revealed. The mirror acts as a portal,
allowing the devotee a glimpse of the future reality that is “just
around the corner” but not yet directly accessible.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-love-temple-eroticism-and-tantra" class="level3">
<h3>4.4 The “Love Temple”: Eroticism and Tantra</h3>
<p>Contrasting with the martial and apocalyptic themes, the temple walls
feature intricate carvings of erotic scenes (Maithuna), leading some
locals and tourists to dub it the “Love Temple”.17 These carvings depict
couples in various stages of intimacy, similar to the famous art of
Khajuraho and Konark.</p>
<p>Integration of Themes: The presence of erotic art on a temple
dedicated to a celibate saint (Hadi Das) and a destructive avatar
(Kalki) might seem contradictory. However, in the Tantric tradition
prevalent in Odisha, sexual union is a symbol of the cosmic union of
Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (energy).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ardhanarishvara:</strong> The temple also houses iconography
or references to the <em>Ardhanarishvara</em> form (half-Shiva,
half-Parvati), symbolizing the perfect balance of male and female
energies.<sup>19</sup> This balance is considered a prerequisite for the
Satya Yuga. The erotic carvings, therefore, are not merely decorative
but serve an <em>apotropaic</em> function (warding off evil/lightning)
and a theological function (celebrating the creative power that will
rebuild the world after the destruction).<sup>21</sup></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. The Theology of Transition: From Jagannath to Kalki</h2>
<section id="the-displacement-of-the-deities" class="level3">
<h3>5.1 The Displacement of the Deities</h3>
<p>The central theological tenet of Chhatia Bata is the “displacement”
of the divine. The <em>Malika</em> prophesies a time when Puri, the
center of the universe, will become uninhabitable due to sin and
environmental collapse. The movement of Jagannath to Chhatia is not just
a relocation; it is a paradigm shift.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Puri:</strong> Represents the <em>Sthiti</em> (Preservation)
phase of the cosmic cycle. Here, the Lord eats, sleeps, and holds
court.</li>
<li><strong>Chhatia:</strong> Represents the <em>Samhara</em>
(Dissolution) and <em>Srishti</em> (Creation) phases. Here, the Lord
arms himself for war.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-new-world-order-arrangement" class="level3">
<h3>5.2 The “New World Order” Arrangement</h3>
<p>In the Puri temple, the deities are seated in a specific order:
Balabhadra (the elder brother) on the left, Subhadra (the sister) in the
center, and Jagannath (the Lord) on the right. This places the sister
under the protection of her brothers.</p>
<p>At Chhatia Bata, the arrangement is distinct: Jagannath - Balabhadra
- Subhadra.2</p>
<p>This sequence follows the oral tradition of how the names are spoken
in Odia (“Jagannath-Balabhadra-Subhadra”). Devotees interpret this
reordering as the “formation for the New World Order”.2 It signifies a
shift in cosmic hierarchy or a tactical formation for the coming battle,
where the Lord takes the lead position.</p>
</section>
<section id="kalki-the-avatar-of-the-5000th-year" class="level3">
<h3>5.3 Kalki: The Avatar of the 5,000th Year</h3>
<p>The Malika asserts that Kalki will not be born at the end of 432,000
years, but has already manifested or will manifest imminently due to the
condensation of time. Achyutananda’s prophecy explicitly states:</p>
<p>“I will leave my Jagannath form… and take birth in a human form in
the house of a pious Brahmin devotee… in Jajpur, Odisha”.13</p>
<p>This localization of the avatar’s birth to Jajpur (the district
containing Chhatia) grounds the universal myth in the local soil. It
empowers the local community, making them the chosen guardians of the
messiah. The prophecy further mentions “Seven Births” or incarnations
that the devotee/Lord takes to prepare for this final role, a concept
echoed in local devotional songs.22</p>

food offerings (<em>Mahaprasad</em>), and service schedules mirror those
of the Puri Jagannath Temple.<sup>3</sup> This mimicry is functional; it
ensures that the temple is inextricably linked to Puri’s spiritual
frequency. If Jagannath were to arrive today, the transition would be
seamless because the rituals are already identical.</p>

<section id="perpetual-construction-the-sound-of-waiting"
class="level3">
<h3>6.2 Perpetual Construction: The Sound of Waiting</h3>
<p>A unique and fascinating feature of Chhatia Bata is the state of
“perpetual construction.” Field observations note that repair works,
expansions, and building activities are ongoing, 24/7.3</p>
<p>Theological Rationale: The priests explain that this construction is
a form of active preparation. “We do not know when the Lord will arrive,
so we must always be building.” The belief is that the construction will
only stop when the deities physically arrive from Puri. The noise of
hammers and chisels is, therefore, a part of the temple’s soundscape, a
constant reminder of the unfinished business of the Kali Yuga.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-rath-yatra" class="level3">
<h3>6.3 The Rath Yatra</h3>
<p>The temple celebrates its own Rath Yatra (Chariot Festival), which
attracts thousands of pilgrims.<sup>1</sup> While Rath Yatras are common
across Odisha, the one at Chhatia is viewed as a “dress rehearsal” for
the final migration. The chariot here is not just a vehicle for a yearly
outing; it represents the ark that will carry the Lord across the rising
waters.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-economy-of-devotion-chhatia-peda" class="level3">
<h3>6.4 The Economy of Devotion: Chhatia Peda</h3>
<p>Embedded in the temple’s culture is the <strong>Chhatia
Peda</strong>, a local sweetmeat made of condensed milk.<sup>1</sup>
Sold in shops lining the entrance, these sweets are famous across the
state. They are branded with specific punch marks to denote
authenticity. The consumption of the Peda is part of the pilgrimage
experience-a taste of the sweetness that sustains the devotee while
waiting for the bitter end of the world.</p>

<h2>7. Socio-Political Implications of the Prophecies</h2>
<section id="the-politics-of-the-apocalypse" class="level3">
<h3>7.1 The Politics of the Apocalypse</h3>
<p>The <em>Malika</em> prophecies have profound socio-political
implications. By predicting a war with “China and 13 Islamic nations,”
the text aligns the spiritual struggle of the Kali Yuga with modern
nationalist anxieties.<sup>14</sup> It frames the defense of India not
just as a secular duty but as a divine mandate. The “United India”
prophecy appeals to a vision of <em>Akhand Bharat</em> (Undivided
India), resonating with certain political ideologies in contemporary
India.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-democratization-of-salvation" class="level3">
<h3>7.2 The Democratization of Salvation</h3>
<p>The <em>Panchasakha</em> movement, of which Hadi Das was a scion, was
fundamentally about breaking the Brahminical monopoly on salvation. By
writing in Odia and placing the center of the world in a village
(Chhatia) rather than the elite center of Puri, the tradition empowers
the rural masses. The <em>Malika</em> warns that in the final days, “the
rules and principles of scriptures” will be ignored by the elites, and
true spirituality will be found in the devotion of the simple
believer.<sup>13</sup> Chhatia Bata serves as the cathedral of this
subaltern spirituality.</p>
</section>
<section id="managing-fear-and-hope" class="level3">
<h3>7.3 Managing Fear and Hope</h3>
<p>The predictions of natural disasters, while terrifying, also provide
a framework for resilience. When Cyclone Fani struck, the devotees saw
it not as random chaos, but as a confirmation of their faith. The
<em>Malika</em> converts the anxiety of climate change and geopolitical
instability into a structured narrative with a guaranteed happy ending
(the Satya Yuga). Chhatia Bata acts as the physical anchor for this
hope-a place that will survive when all else falls.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chhatia Bata stands as a unique monument in the religious landscape
of India. It is a site where the boundaries between the past, present,
and future blur. It venerates a past saint (Hadi Das) who is believed to
be a reincarnation of an even older saint (Achyutananda). It mimics the
present rituals of a great temple (Puri) to prepare for a future
displacement. It worships a deity (Kalki) who has not yet fully
arrived.</p>
<p>The temple is a complex synthesis of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vaishnava Theology:</strong> The avatars of Vishnu and the
sanctity of Jagannath.</li>
<li><strong>Tantric Prophecy:</strong> The cryptic codes of the
<em>Malika</em> and the erotic/dualistic symbolism of the art.</li>
<li><strong>Ecological Anxiety:</strong> The fear of <em>Pralaya</em>
(flood) and the preservation of the sacred land.</li>
<li><strong>Nationalist Eschatology:</strong> The vision of a divine war
and a united India.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the “Second Srikshetra,” Chhatia Bata does not seek to replace
Puri in the present, but to succeed it in the future. It is a “Fortress
of Faith” built on the bedrock of prophecy, manned by a lineage of gurus
who keep the watch, and sustained by a community that believes, with
unwavering certainty, that the sword of the Lord is growing, the sea is
rising, and the gates of Chhatia will one day open to receive the
refugees of the Kali Yuga.</p>
