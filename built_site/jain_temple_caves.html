<h2 id="1-introduction-the-lithic-landscape-of-ancient-kalinga">1. Introduction: The Lithic Landscape of Ancient Kalinga</h2>
<p>In the coastal heartland of Odisha, rising from the lateritic plains of the Khurda district, stand two opposing sandstone eminences that constitute one of the most significant archaeological landscapes in Eastern India. Separated by a narrow defile through which the modern road passes, these twin hills-Udayagiri (Hill of Sunrise) and Khandagiri (Broken Hill)-represent a continuous chronicle of Jain monasticism, royal patronage, and rock-cut architecture spanning over two millennia.<sup id="cite-ref-1"><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> Historically identified as the <em>Kumari Parvata</em> in the celebrated Hathigumpha inscription, these hills served as the spiritual epicenter of the ancient Kalingan empire, particularly during the ascendancy of the Mahameghavahana dynasty in the 1st century BCE.<sup id="cite-ref-2"><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The site comprises a sprawling necropolis of thirty-three extant rock-cut caves-eighteen excavated into the scarp of Udayagiri and fifteen into Khandagiri-though historical enumerations suggest the original complex may have housed as many as 117 distinct excavations.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> Unlike the monolithic grandeur of the trap-rock excavations in Western India (such as Ajanta or Ellora), the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves are carved from coarse-grained, brittle sandstone. This geological reality necessitated a unique architectural vocabulary; rather than deep, cavernous prayer halls (<em>chaityas</em>), the Kalingan artisans focused on multi-storied residential cells (<em>lenas</em>) arranged around open courtyards, emphasizing exterior ornamentation over interior volume.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive, expert-level analysis of the site. It dissects the complex stratigraphy of the hills, moving from the political zenith of Emperor Kharavela in the 1st century BCE to the medieval renaissance under the Somavamsis, and finally to the Maratha-period construction of the Digambara Jain temple that crowns the summit of Khandagiri today. Through a detailed examination of epigraphic records, architectural morphology, acoustic properties, and iconographic evolution, this study elucidates the role of <em>Kumari Parvata</em> not merely as a retreat for ascetics, but as a theater of state power and a crucible of early Indian art.</p>
<h2 id="2-geo-political-context-and-historical-background">2. Geo-Political Context and Historical Background</h2>
<p>To comprehend the significance of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri complex, one must situate it within the volatile geopolitical landscape of post-Mauryan India. The decline of the Mauryan Empire in the 2nd century BCE created a power vacuum across the subcontinent, leading to the rise of regional dynasties asserting their autonomy against the waning power of Magadha. In the region of Kalinga (modern coastal Odisha), this resurgence was spearheaded by the Mahameghavahana dynasty, also known as the Chedi dynasty.<sup id="cite-ref-2"><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="21-the-rise-of-the-mahameghavahana-dynasty">2.1 The Rise of the Mahameghavahana Dynasty</h3>
<p>The Mahameghavahanas emerged as the custodians of Kalingan identity, which had been brutally suppressed during the Kalinga War of Ashoka (c. 261 BCE). The dynasty’s most illustrious ruler, Emperor Kharavela, is the central protagonist of the Udayagiri narrative. Before the discovery of the Hathigumpha inscription in Cave 14, Kharavela was a phantom in Indian history, absent from the Puranic lists that typically chronicle royal lineages. His emergence from the lithic records of Udayagiri revolutionized the understanding of Eastern India’s political history, presenting Kalinga not as a peripheral vassal but as an imperial core capable of challenging the hegemony of Magadha and the Satavahanas.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The dynasty claimed descent from the “Royal Sage Vasu” and styled themselves as <em>Kalingadhipati</em> (Lords of Kalinga) and <em>Maharaja</em>.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Their capital, Kalinganagari, is frequently identified with the fortified site of Sisupalgarh located near the twin hills, suggesting an intimate spatial relationship between the royal citadel and the monastic retreat.<sup id="cite-ref-8"><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="22-the-religious-landscape-jainism-as-state-dharma">2.2 The Religious Landscape: Jainism as State Dharma</h3>
<p>While the Mauryas had propagated Buddhism, the Mahameghavahanas were staunch patrons of Jainism. The Udayagiri complex was developed primarily as a <em>varsha-vasa</em> (monsoonal retreat) for Jain ascetics (<em>Nirgrantha</em>). The architecture reflects the severe austerities of the Jain path: the cells are small, devoid of creature comforts, and feature sloping stone floors with raised pillows for sleeping.<sup id="cite-ref-2"><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> However, this asceticism was paradoxically supported by immense royal wealth. Kharavela describes himself as a “worshipper of all sects” (<em>sava-pasanda pujako</em>) but explicitly directs his primary patronage toward the Jain <em>Sangha</em>, recovering sacred Jain icons and constructing elaborate dwelling places.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> This synthesis of imperial aggression and religious piety characterizes the unique ethos of the site.</p>
<h3 id="23-the-strategic-geography-of-the-twin-hills">2.3 The Strategic Geography of the Twin Hills</h3>
<p>The location of the caves is not accidental. The hills command a panoramic view of the Mahanadi delta and the ancient trade routes connecting Kalinga to the Deccan and the Ganges valley. The inscription mentions the <em>Tanasuliya</em> road and the extension of canals, indicating that the hills were integrated into a sophisticated hydraulic and transport network.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> The sandstone composition of the hills, while fragile, allowed for rapid excavation, enabling the dynasty to create a monumental legacy within a single generation-a feat that the harder basalts of the Deccan would have delayed by decades.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-hathigumpha-inscription-the-magna-carta-of-kalinga">3. The Hathigumpha Inscription: The Magna Carta of Kalinga</h2>
<p>The <em>Hathigumpha</em> (Elephant Cave) inscription, located on the brow of Cave 14 in Udayagiri, is arguably the most critical historical document for the 1st century BCE in Eastern India. Consisting of seventeen lines of deep-cut Brahmi script in the Prakrit language, it provides a year-by-year annalistic account of Kharavela’s reign.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="31-paleography-and-decipherment-history">3.1 Paleography and Decipherment History</h3>
<p>The inscription was first brought to the attention of the scholarly world by A. Stirling in 1820, but it was James Prinsep who first attempted a decipherment in 1837. The text is notoriously difficult to read due to natural weathering; for centuries, rainwater dripping from the overhanging rock has eroded the central lines (lines 7-15), leading to divergent readings by scholars such as R.L. Mitra, Bhagwanlal Indraji, and later, the definitive edits by K.P. Jayaswal and R.D. Banerji.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Paleographically, the script belongs to the mid-1st century BCE, exhibiting forms slightly developed from the Ashokan Brahmi but distinct from the later Kushana styles. This dating is corroborated by the artistic style of the accompanying sculptures in the caves.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="32-detailed-chronological-analysis-of-the-reign">3.2 Detailed Chronological Analysis of the Reign</h3>
<p>The inscription is structured as a <em>Prashasti</em> (eulogy), but unlike the poetic ambiguity of later Gupta inscriptions, it offers concrete data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Coronation (Years 0-24):</strong> The text details the Prince’s education in <em>Lekha</em> (correspondence), <em>Rupa</em> (currency/finance), <em>Ganana</em> (accountancy), and <em>Vyavahara</em> (law). This curriculum reveals the sophisticated administrative training required of early Indian kings. He served as <em>Yuvaraja</em> for nine years before being crowned at age 24.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 1 (Reconstruction):</strong> Kharavela’s first act was the restoration of his capital, Kalinganagari, which had been devastated by a cyclone. He repaired gates, ramparts, and buildings, and restored gardens and tanks at a cost of 3,500,000 coins. This entry provides rare evidence of the historical frequency of cyclones in Odisha and the state’s capacity for disaster management.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 2 (The Western Expedition):</strong> In a bold geopolitical move, Kharavela sent a vast army of cavalry, elephants, infantry, and chariots to the west, “disregarding Satakarni” (the powerful Satavahana king). The army reached the river <em>Kanhabemna</em> (Krishna) and terrorized the city of the Mushikas. This establishes the synchronicity between Kharavela and Satakarni I, a crucial anchor for Indian chronology.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 4 (The Vidyadhara Campaign):</strong> The King subdued the Rathikas and Bhojakas, tribal chieftaincies in the Berar/Maharashtra region. These groups were likely feudatories of the Satavahanas, implying that Kharavela was chipping away at his rival’s periphery.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 5 (The Nanda Canal):</strong> A major hydraulic project is recorded: the extension of a canal originally excavated by “King Nanda” (<em>Nandaraja</em>) either 103 or 300 years prior (<em>ti-vasa-sata</em>). This canal was brought into the capital via Tanasuli. This line confirms that Kalinga was part of the Nanda Empire (4th century BCE) and highlights the long-term continuity of irrigation infrastructure in the region.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 8 (The Northern Campaign and Yavana Conflict):</strong> Kharavela stormed Gorathagiri (Barabar Hills) and pressed towards Rajagriha. The inscription states that upon hearing this, the <strong>Yavana King</strong> retreated to Mathura.</li>
<li><em>The Demetrius Controversy:</em> Early scholars like Jayaswal read the Yavana king’s name as “Dimita” (Demetrius). However, Demetrius I ruled c. 180 BCE, which conflicts with the late 1st-century BCE paleography. Modern scholars (Sircar, Thapar) regard the reading as doubtful or referring to a later Indo-Greek ruler. Nevertheless, the mention of a Greek king confirms the extent of the Indo-Greek penetration into the Gangetic heartland.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 12 (The Victory over Magadha):</strong> The climax of his military career. Kharavela watered his elephants in the Ganges and compelled <strong>Bahasatimita</strong> (identified by some as Pushyamitra Sunga or a localized Magadhan ruler) to bow at his feet.</li>
<li><em>Recovery of the Kalinga Jina:</em> Most significantly, he brought back the “Kalinga Jina,” a sacred Jain image that had been looted by the Nanda King centuries earlier. This act of “heritage repatriation” served as a powerful symbol of Kalinga’s restored sovereignty and national pride.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Regnal Year 13 (The Religious Turn):</strong> The narrative shifts from conquest to piety. On the <em>Kumari Parvata</em> (Udayagiri), Kharavela excavated caves for Jain monks, erected pillars, and held a council of ascetics, distributing white garments. This marks the transition of the site from a natural retreat to a royal monastery.<sup id="cite-ref-6"><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-architectural-survey-of-udayagiri-sunrise-hill">4. Architectural Survey of Udayagiri (Sunrise Hill)</h2>
<p>The Udayagiri hill, housing 18 caves, represents the royal precinct of the complex. The caves here are more ornate, larger, and historically significant than those on Khandagiri.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="41-cave-1-rani-gumpha-the-queens-cave">4.1 Cave 1: Rani Gumpha (The Queen’s Cave)</h3>
<p>The <em>Rani Gumpha</em> is the architectural masterpiece of the site. It is a double-storeyed monastery located on the eastern slope, designed in a U-shape with a spacious open courtyard.<sup id="cite-ref-2"><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structural Morphology:</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lower Storey:</strong> The main wing features seven entrances opening into cells, flanked by side wings. The verandas are supported by pillars (now mostly reconstructed).</li>
<li><strong>Upper Storey:</strong> Accessible by a flight of steps, the upper veranda is supported by nine columns. The cells here are more spacious, suggesting they were reserved for high-ranking monks or perhaps the royal family during retreats.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>The Acoustic Theatre Hypothesis:</strong></li>
<li>Scholars such as C. Thomas Ault have proposed that Rani Gumpha functioned as an ancient acoustical theatre. Computerized modeling using CATT-Acoustic software indicates that the courtyard (serving as an <em>orchestra</em>) and the pillared cells (acting as resonators) possess acoustic properties similar to Hellenistic theaters described by Vitruvius.<sup id="cite-ref-17"><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> The “canting” of the upper storey walls and the specific dimensions create a reverberation field ideal for speech and music. This aligns with the Hathigumpha inscription’s mention of Kharavela entertaining his subjects with <em>Gandharva</em> (music and dance).<sup id="cite-ref-16"><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Iconography and Friezes:</strong></li>
<li>The friezes of Rani Gumpha are secular and narrative, depicting royal processions, hunting scenes, and combat.</li>
<li><strong>The Yavana Guard:</strong> A high-relief sculpture on the upper right wing depicts a <em>dvarapala</em> (door guardian) wearing a short kilt, boots, and a headband-attire distinctly non-Indian and identified as Greek (<em>Yavana</em>). This visual evidence corroborates the text’s mention of contact with the Yavana kingdom.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>The Duel Scene:</strong> One frieze depicts a duel between a man and a woman, which some art historians interpret as a scene from a lost play or a historic event, emphasizing the martial culture of the period.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="42-cave-10-ganesha-gumpha">4.2 Cave 10: Ganesha Gumpha</h3>
<p>Located higher up the hill, Ganesha Gumpha is pivotal for understanding the site’s evolution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guardians:</strong> The entrance is flanked by two massive, monolithic elephants holding lotus flowers and mango branches. This is the earliest known instance in Indian architecture of elephants functioning as guardians, a motif that would later become ubiquitous in temple architecture.<sup id="cite-ref-20"><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>The Udayana-Vasavadatta Frieze:</strong> The veranda features a detailed narrative relief depicting the romantic legend of King Udayana of Kausambi and Princess Vasavadatta of Ujjayini. Scenes include the elopement on an elephant, the battle with pursuers, and the subsequent dejection of the soldiers. The presence of such romantic literature in a monastic cave suggests a liberal intellectual atmosphere where monks were conversant with secular courtly epics.<sup id="cite-ref-20"><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>The Ganesha Image:</strong> The cave derives its name from a relief of Ganesha carved on the rear wall of the right cell. Crucially, this image is a <strong>medieval addition</strong> (Somavamsi period), superimposed on the ancient structure. It illustrates the site’s transition from exclusive Jainism to a syncretic environment where Hindu deities were integrated.<sup id="cite-ref-20"><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="43-cave-9-manchapuri-and-swargapuri">4.3 Cave 9: Manchapuri and Swargapuri</h3>
<p>This double-storeyed complex is vital for dynastic history.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inscriptions:</strong></li>
<li>The upper storey (<em>Swargapuri</em>) bears an inscription of Kharavela’s <strong>Chief Queen</strong> (<em>Aga-Mahisi</em>), identifying her as the daughter of the King of Hastimipura (possibly Hathigumpha or a separate kingdom). This highlights the high status of women and their independent capacity to patronize architecture.<sup id="cite-ref-21"><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup></li>
<li>The lower storey (<em>Manchapuri</em>) contains inscriptions of King <strong>Kudepasiri</strong> (Kharavela’s successor) and Prince <strong>Vadukha</strong>. These records prove that the dynasty continued to support the site after Kharavela, although the grandeur of construction diminished.<sup id="cite-ref-22"><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Reliefs:</strong> The central relief depicts a royal group (King, Queen, and Prince) worshipping a religious symbol (possibly the Kalinga Jina or a Tree). This is a rare portrait of the royal family in a devotional context.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="44-cave-12-vyaghra-gumpha-the-tiger-cave">4.4 Cave 12: Vyaghra Gumpha (The Tiger Cave)</h3>
<p>This small cave represents a unique zoomorphic experiment in rock-cut architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> The entrance is carved to resemble the gaping mouth of a tiger, with the upper jaw forming the roof and the throat leading into the cell. This terrifying facade was likely symbolic, representing the ascetic’s triumph over fear and the wild nature of the forest.<sup id="cite-ref-24"><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Inscription:</strong> An inscription identifies it as the donation of the “Town Judge” (<em>Nagara-Akhadamsa</em>) named <strong>Sabhuti</strong>. This indicates that patronage extended beyond the royal family to the bureaucratic elite of Kalinganagari.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="45-cave-14-hathi-gumpha-the-elephant-cave">4.5 Cave 14: Hathi Gumpha (The Elephant Cave)</h3>
<p>While architecturally simple-a large natural cavern with little modification-its historical weight is immense.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Inscription:</strong> The brow of the cave bears the 17-line Hathigumpha inscription. The preservation of the text here, despite the natural cave setting, suggests it was chosen for its visibility and permanence.<sup id="cite-ref-15"><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Structural Failure:</strong> The veranda pillars have collapsed, likely due to the poor quality of the sandstone and the widening of the natural fissure, a reminder of the geological challenges faced by the artisans.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="46-other-significant-caves-on-udayagiri">4.6 Other Significant Caves on Udayagiri</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cave 3 (Chota Hathi Gumpha):</strong> Features six small elephant figures on the facade, echoing the larger guardians of Ganesha Gumpha.<sup id="cite-ref-3"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Cave 5 (Jaya Vijaya Gumpha):</strong> A double-storeyed cave named after the two donors mentioned in its inscription. It features a Bodhi tree worship scene, illustrating the shared artistic vocabulary between Jainism and Buddhism.<sup id="cite-ref-26"><a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Cave 13 (Sarpa Gumpha):</strong> A tiny cave where the door arch is topped by a three-headed cobra hood, symbolizing the protection of the Tirthankara Parshvanatha.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-architectural-survey-of-khandagiri-broken-hill">5. Architectural Survey of Khandagiri (Broken Hill)</h2>
<p>Across the road lies Khandagiri. While Udayagiri represents the royal, secular-narrative phase of the 1st century BCE, Khandagiri embodies a longer chronological span, evolving from ancient dwelling cells to a medieval Tantric Jain sanctuary.<sup id="cite-ref-28"><a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="51-cave-3-ananta-gumpha-the-cave-of-the-serpent">5.1 Cave 3: Ananta Gumpha (The Cave of the Serpent)</h3>
<p>The most important ancient cave on Khandagiri, roughly contemporary with Rani Gumpha.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Arches (Toranas):</strong> The doorways are surmounted by tympanums featuring exquisite low-relief carvings that rival the Sunga art of Bharhut:</li>
<li><strong>Gajalakshmi:</strong> The goddess Lakshmi stands on a lotus, bathed by two elephants pouring water from pitchers. This is an early, pan-Indian symbol of prosperity and royalty, later adopted into the Hindu pantheon.<sup id="cite-ref-29"><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Surya (The Sun God):</strong> A figure driving a chariot drawn by four horses (unlike the seven horses of later iconography), accompanied by the dispellers of darkness. This reflects the early solar cults prevalent in Eastern India.<sup id="cite-ref-27"><a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Sacred Tree:</strong> A tree enclosed in a railing (<em>vedika</em>), worshipped by figures with umbrellas, representing the <em>Kevala-jnana</em> (omniscience) of the Tirthankara.<sup id="cite-ref-29"><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="52-caves-1-2-tatowa-gumpha-the-parrot-caves">5.2 Caves 1 &amp; 2: Tatowa Gumpha (The Parrot Caves)</h3>
<p>Named after the figures of parrots (<em>Tatowa</em>) carved on the door arches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inscription:</strong> The inscription mentions that the cave was excavated by the attendant <em>Kusuma</em>. The use of bird motifs is decorative but also possibly symbolic of the transmission of teachings.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> These caves feature simple single-cell layouts with pillared verandas, characteristic of the early phase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="53-the-medieval-group-navamuni-barabhuji-and-trisula">5.3 The Medieval Group: Navamuni, Barabhuji, and Trisula</h3>
<p>A significant cluster of caves on Khandagiri (Caves 7, 8, 9) was modified or excavated during the Somavamsi period (11th century CE), marking a theological shift in Odishan Jainism.<sup id="cite-ref-2"><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iconographic Revolution:</strong> Unlike the aniconic Kharavela period (where the Jina was represented by symbols), these caves are filled with high-relief sculptures of the Tirthankaras in human form.</li>
<li><strong>Barabhuji Gumpha (Cave 8):</strong> Named after the twelve-armed (<em>Barabhuji</em>) Sasana Devi Chakresvari. The walls are carved with the figures of all 24 Tirthankaras, each accompanied by their specific <em>Sasana Devi</em> (attendant goddess). This highlights the influence of <strong>Tantric Jainism</strong>, where the worship of female deities (<em>Yakshinis</em>) gained prominence alongside the Tirthankaras.<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Trisula Gumpha:</strong> Features a unique arrangement of three Tirthankaras, giving the cave its name (Trident/Three-pronged). The roughness of the sculpture compared to the delicate work of Ananta Gumpha indicates the decline in stone-carving finesse by the medieval period.<sup id="cite-ref-29"><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-the-digambara-jain-temple-the-crown-of-khandagiri">6. The Digambara Jain Temple: The Crown of Khandagiri</h2>
<p>Ascending the steps past the medieval caves, one reaches the flat summit of Khandagiri, which is crowned by a living place of worship-the Digambara Jain Temple.<sup id="cite-ref-31"><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="61-historical-stratigraphy-and-maratha-patronage">6.1 Historical Stratigraphy and Maratha Patronage</h3>
<p>While guides and local legends often attribute the temple’s foundation to Kharavela, architectural analysis confirms it is a much later structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maratha Period Construction:</strong> The current edifice was constructed in the first quarter of the <strong>19th century</strong> (c. 1800-1825 CE) under the patronage of the Maratha rulers of Cuttack, who controlled Odisha before the British conquest in 1803.<sup id="cite-ref-31"><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Reuse of Antiquity:</strong> Despite its “modern” date, the temple stands on a site of ancient sanctity. It is built using stone salvaged from earlier, collapsed temples or caves on the hill. This continuity of site-where a 19th-century temple sits atop 1st-century BCE foundations-exemplifies the concept of a <em>Tirtha</em> (crossing place), which remains sacred across dynasties.<sup id="cite-ref-31"><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="62-architectural-style">6.2 Architectural Style</h3>
<p>The temple is a quintessential example of the <strong>Kalingan Pidha</strong> order, adapted for Jain worship.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan and Elevation:</strong> It follows a <em>triratha</em> (three-projection) plan. The elevation consists of a <em>Vimana</em> (sanctum) with a curvilinear spire and a <em>Jagamohana</em> (rectangular porch) with a pyramidal roof. The walls are constructed of dressed sandstone ashlar.<sup id="cite-ref-31"><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Exterior:</strong> The exterior walls are relatively plain compared to Hindu temples of Bhubaneswar, reflecting Jain austerity, but feature <em>Khakhara-mundi</em> and <em>Pidha-mundi</em> niches.<sup id="cite-ref-31"><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="63-iconography-and-deities">6.3 Iconography and Deities</h3>
<p>The temple complex comprises three main shrines, housing icons that bridge the ancient and modern eras:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Deity:</strong> The central shrine houses a colossal black stone image of <strong>Parshvanatha</strong> (the 23rd Tirthankara), standing in <em>Kayotsarga</em> (body-abandonment) pose beneath a seven-hooded serpent canopy. This image is likely of medieval origin (Somavamsi period) and was re-consecrated in the new temple.<sup id="cite-ref-32"><a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Mahavira:</strong> A secondary shrine contains a white marble idol of <strong>Mahavira</strong> (the 24th Tirthankara), reflecting the material preferences of North Indian Jain communities (Marwari/Gujarati) who contributed to the temple’s later maintenance.<sup id="cite-ref-33"><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>The Five Tirthankaras:</strong> A third shrine contains a panel of five Tirthankaras, emphasizing the <em>Panch-Kalyanaka</em> concept.<sup id="cite-ref-33"><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="64-the-living-tradition">6.4 The Living Tradition</h3>
<p>Unlike the caves below, which are archaeological monuments managed by the ASI, the temple is an active place of worship managed by the <em>Bengal, Bihar and Odisha Digambar Jain Tirthkshetra Committee</em>.<sup id="cite-ref-31"><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup> It remains a focal point for the Jain community, particularly during Mahavir Jayanti, where the continuity of worship links the modern devotee to the ascetic traditions of Kharavela’s time.</p>

<h2 id="7-art-historical-analysis-the-kalinga-school">7. Art Historical Analysis: The Kalinga School</h2>
<p>The art of Udayagiri and Khandagiri constitutes a distinct “School of Kalinga Art,” which operates in dialogue with the contemporary schools of Bharhut (Sunga) and Sanchi (Satavahana).<sup id="cite-ref-34"><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="71-stylistic-characteristics">7.1 Stylistic Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical Perspective:</strong> The artisans employed a “vertical perspective” where objects in the distance are placed above, rather than behind, foreground objects. This creates a flattened, tapestry-like effect.<sup id="cite-ref-35"><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Robust Physiognomy:</strong> The human figures are depicted with heavy, earthy bodies-broad chests, thick limbs, and large heads. This stylistic trait links them to the <em>Yaksha</em> and <em>Yakshi</em> figures of the Mauryan era, suggesting a folk-art origin for the stone carving tradition.<sup id="cite-ref-36"><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Narrative Dynamism:</strong> Unlike the static poses of the medieval period, the Kharavela-era reliefs are full of movement. In Rani Gumpha, women fight lions, kings hunt deer, and dancers perform with vigor. This reflects a “world-affirming” artistic spirit that seemingly contradicts the “world-denying” asceticism of the caves.<sup id="cite-ref-27"><a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="72-comparison-with-bharhut-and-sanchi">7.2 Comparison with Bharhut and Sanchi</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secular Subject Matter:</strong> While Bharhut and Sanchi focus almost exclusively on <em>Jataka</em> tales and the life of Buddha, the Udayagiri reliefs are strikingly secular. There are no obvious “Jain Puranic” stories (like the lives of Tirthankaras) in the early caves. Instead, we see the King’s biography, courtly romances (Udayana-Vasavadatta), and scenes of daily life. This suggests that the art was intended to glorify the Royal Patron as much as the religion.<sup id="cite-ref-35"><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Aniconism:</strong> Like early Buddhism, early Kalingan Jainism was aniconic. The Tirthankara is never depicted in human form in the 1st-century caves. Instead, the <em>Swastika</em>, <em>Nandipada</em> (taurine symbol), <em>Triratna</em>, and <em>Chaitya-Vriksha</em> (Sacred Tree) serve as proxies for the divine. The shift to anthropomorphic icons occurs only in the medieval Khandagiri caves, paralleling the shift in Buddhism from Hinayana to Mahayana iconography.<sup id="cite-ref-37"><a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8-second-and-third-order-insights">8. Second and Third-Order Insights</h2>
<h3 id="81-the-jain-state-paradox">8.1 The “Jain State” Paradox</h3>
<p>The analysis of the site reveals a profound third-order insight: Under Kharavela, Jainism functioned as a “State Religion” in a manner usually associated with Ashokan Buddhism or Gupta Hinduism. The Hathigumpha inscription uses religious rhetoric (<em>Dharma-raja</em>) to justify military aggression (<em>Digvijaya</em>). The “Kalinga Jina” was not just a religious idol but a <strong>Palladium of the State</strong>-its possession conferred legitimacy. This challenges the simplistic view of Jainism as a politically passive faith; here, it was the ideological engine of an empire.</p>
<h3 id="82-the-theater-of-power">8.2 The Theater of Power</h3>
<p>The acoustic evidence from Rani Gumpha suggests that the distinction between “monastery” and “palace” was blurred. If the King held musical performances (<em>Gandharva</em>) within the monastic complex, it implies that the Jain monks were not isolated recluses but integral components of the royal court’s cultural life. The caves were a stage where the King demonstrated his piety to the public, turning asceticism into a spectacle of state benevolence.</p>
<h3 id="83-heritage-repatriation-and-national-identity">8.3 Heritage Repatriation and National Identity</h3>
<p>Kharavela’s recovery of the Jina image from Magadha is one of the earliest recorded instances of <strong>heritage repatriation</strong> in global history. It demonstrates that ancient Indian states possessed a deep sense of historical memory (remembering a theft from 300 years prior) and linked their political legitimacy to specific cultural artifacts. The “Kalinga Jina” was the soul of the nation, and its return was the ultimate validation of Kharavela’s rule.</p>
<h2 id="9-conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The twin hills of Udayagiri and Khandagiri are more than a collection of rock-cut shelters; they are a lithic archive of a civilization that rose from the ashes of the Mauryan conquest to assert its own imperial identity. From the “tiger’s mouth” of Cave 12 to the acoustic courtyard of Rani Gumpha, and from the defiant lines of the Hathigumpha inscription to the quiet sanctity of the summit temple, the site encapsulates the resilience of the Kalingan spirit.</p>
<p>It tells the story of a King who conquered India to restore his nation’s pride, of a Queen who patronized the arts, and of a community of monks who dwelt in the heart of the stone. Today, as the bells of the Digambara temple ring out over the silent, empty cells of the ancient ascetics, the hills remain a living testament to the endurance of faith and the permanence of stone.</p>
