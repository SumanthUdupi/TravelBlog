# World-Building & Context

## Summary
Framework for building richer contextual layers (historical, cultural, sensory) to support immersive experiences.

## Layers of Context
- **Historical**: timelines, era tags, key figures
- **Cultural**: rituals, local practices, etiquette
- **Sensory**: soundscapes, imagery cues, ambient descriptions
- **Practical**: maps, routes, accessibility, safety

## Implementation Patterns
- Use expandable context panes to avoid cluttering main narrative
- Create reusable context blocks (e.g., timeline widgets)
- Provide optional deeper dives (scholarly notes vs. visitor summaries)

## Action Items
1. Build a context library (timelines, glossary entries)
2. Tag assets with context metadata for reuse
3. Prototype map-based contextual layers for a sample route
